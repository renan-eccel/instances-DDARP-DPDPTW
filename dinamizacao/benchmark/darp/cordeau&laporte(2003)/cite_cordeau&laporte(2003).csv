To a high degree these needs can be fulfilled by individual and public transport. People that do not have access to the former and cannot use the latter require additional means of transportation. This is where dial-a-ride services come into play. The dial-a-ride problem considers transportation requests of people from pick-up to drop-off locations. Users specify time windows with respect to these points. Requests are served by a given vehicle fleet with limited capacity and tour duration per vehicle. Moreover, user inconvenience considerations are taken into account by limiting the travel time between origin and destination for each request. Previous research on the dial-a-ride problem primarily focused on serving a given set of requests with a fixed-size vehicle fleet at minimal traveling costs. It is assumed that the request set is sufficiently small to be served by the available vehicles. We consider a different scenario in which a maximal number of requests shall be served under the given constraints, i.e., it is no longer guaranteed that all requests can be accepted. For this new problem variant we propose a compact mixed integer linear programming model as well as algorithms based on Benders decomposition. In particular, we employ logic-based Benders decomposition and branch-and-check using mixed integer linear programming and constraint programming algorithms. We consider different variants on how to generate Benders cuts as well as heuristic boosting techniques and different types of valid inequalities. Computational experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the suggested algorithms. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Branch-and-check; Combinatorial Benders cuts; Dial-a-Ride problem; Logic-based Benders decomposition; Transportation","Computation theory; Computer circuits; Computer programming; Constraint theory; Fleet operations; Stochastic programming; Transportation; Travel time; Vehicles; Branch-and-check; Combinatorial Benders cuts; Computational experiment; Dial-a-ride problem; Logic-based benders decompositions; Means of transportations; Mixed integer linear programming; Mixed integer linear programming model; Integer programming",,,,,"Baklagis, D.G., Dikas, G., Minis, I., The team orienteering pick-up and delivery problem with time windows and its applications in fleet sizing (2016) RAIRO-Oper.

Similarly to SARP. taxi in G-SARP can service passenger and package requests at the same time. However, G-SARP allows the taxi to transport more than one passenger at the same time, which is more beneficial in practical situations. In addition, G-SARP has no restrictions on the maximum riding time o. passenger, and the number of parcel requests that can be inserted between the pick-up and drop-off points o. passenger is limited only by vehicle capacity. simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is proposed to solve G-SARP. The proposed SA algorithm is compared with basic SA and tabu search (TS) algorithms. The results show that the proposed SA algorithm outperforms basic SA and TS algorithms. Moreover, further analysis shows that G-SARP solutions are better than those of SARP in most cases. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","General share-a-ride problem; ride sharing; share-a-ride problem; simulated annealing","Tabu search; Taxicabs; General share-a-ride problem; Ride-sharing; SA algorithm; share-a-ride problem; Simulated annealing algorithms; Tabu search algorithms; TS-algorithms; Vehicle capacity; Simulated annealing",,,,,"Agatz, N., Erera, A., Savelsbergh, M., Wang, X., Optimization for Dynamic Ride-Sharing.

In this new variant of the dial-a-ride problem, en-route modifications of the vehicle's inner configuration are allowed. The main consequence is that the vehicle capacity is defined by a set of configurations and the choice of vehicle configuration is associated with binary decision variables. The problem is modeled as a mixed-integer program derived from the model of the heterogeneous dial-a-ride problem. Vehicle reconfiguration is a lever to efficiently reduce transportation costs, but the number of passengers and vehicle fleet setting make this problem intractable for exact solution methods. A large neighborhood search metaheuristic combined with a set covering component with a reactive mechanism to automatically adjust its parameters is therefore proposed. The resulting framework is evaluated against benchmarks from the literature, used for similar routing problems. It is also applied to a real case, in the context of the transportation of disabled children from their home to medical centers in the city of Lyon, France. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Dial-a-ride problem; Feasibility check; Fleet size and mix problem; Heterogeneous fleet; Large neighborhood search; Reconfigurable vehicles; Set-covering","Integer programming; Vehicles; Dial-a-ride problem; Feasibility check; Fleet size and mixes; Heterogeneous fleet; Large neighborhood search; Reconfigurable; Set coverings; Fleet operations; cost analysis; decision making; disability; technology adoption; transportation technology; travel behavior; Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes; France; Grand Lyon; Lyons",,,,,"Archetti, C., Speranza, M.G., A survey on matheuristics for routing problems (2014) EURO J.

Planning daily PMC transport for ARG ships and nearby airfields is a unique vehicle routing problem characterized by a heterogeneous capacitated vehicle fleet, two cargo types, multiple depots, time windows, and synchronized routing of two aircraft required between some but not all node pairs. We formulate this problem as an integer linear program (ILP) with an objective function that expresses the cost of flight operations and a penalty for undelivered PMC. We perform extensive computational testing using an ILP solver and a tailored ant colony optimization with local search metaheuristic on test instances constructed to represent those found in practice. We find most instances difficult to solve optimally while our heuristic provides the best known or close to the best known solution in just a few minutes. We have embedded our heuristic in a decision support system complete with graphical user interface and sent this out for use by United States Navy ARG planners. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Ant colony optimization; Integer linear programming; Local search; Military; Vehicle routing",,,,,,"Barbarosoğlu, G., Özdamar, L., Cevik, A., An interactive approach for hierarchical analysis of helicopter logistics in disaster relief operations (2002) European Journal of Operational Research, 140 (1), pp. 118-133; Belanger, N., Desaulniers, G., Soumis, F., Desrosiers, J., Periodic airline fleet assignment with time windows, spacing constraints, and time dependent revenues (2006) European Journal of Operational Research, 175 (3), pp. 1754-1766; Bent, R., Van Hentenryck, P., A two-stage hybrid algorithm for pickup and delivery vehicle routing problems with time windows (2006) Computers & Operations Research, 33 (4), pp. 875-893; Braekers, K., Caris, A., Janssens, G.K., Exact and meta-heuristic approach for a general heterogeneous dial-a-ride problem with multiple depots (2014) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 67, pp. 166-186; Bredström, D., Rönnqvist, M., Combined vehicle routing and scheduling with temporal precedence and synchronization constraints (2008) European Journal of Operational Research, 191 (1), pp. 19-31; Brown, G.G., Carlyle, W.M., Dell, R.F., Optimizing intratheater military airlift in iraq and afghanistan (2013) Military Operations Research, 18 (3), pp. 35-52; Cherkesly, M., Desaulniers, G., Irnich, S., Laporte, G., Branch-price-and-cut algorithms for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows and multiple stacks (2016) European Journal of Operational Research, 250 (3), pp. 782-793; Cheung, R.K., Shi, N., Powell, W.B., Simao, H.P., An attribute-decision model for cross-border drayage problem (2008) Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 44 (2), pp. 217-234; Cordeau, J.-F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54 (3), pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem (darp): Variants, modeling issues and algorithms (2003) Quarterly Journal of the Belgian, French and Italian Operations Research Societies, 1 (2), pp. 89-101; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 37 (6), pp. 579-594; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem: Models and algorithms (2007) Annals of Operations Research, 153 (1), pp. 29-46; Dantzig, G.B., Ramser, J.H., The truck dispatching problem (1959) Management Science, 6 (1), pp. 80-91; De Rosa, B., Improta, G., Ghiani, G., Musmanno, R., The arc routing and scheduling problem with transshipment (2002) Transportation Science, 36 (3), pp. 301-313; Del Pia, A., Filippi, C., A variable neighborhood descent algorithm for a real waste collection problem with mobile depots (2006) International Transactions in Operational Research, 13 (2), pp. 125-141; Desaulniers, G., Desrosiers, J., Erdmann, A., Solomon, M.M., Soumis, F., Vrp with pickup and delivery (2002) SIAM Monographs on Discrete Mathematics and Applications, pp. 225-242; Desrosiers, J., Dumas, Y., Soumis, F., A dynamic programming solution of the large-scale single-vehicle dial—a-ride problem with time windows (1986) American Journal of Mathematical and Management Sciences, 6 (3-4), pp. 301-325; Detti, P., Papalini, F., de Lara, G.Z.M., A multi-depot dial-a-ride problem with heterogeneous vehicles and compatibility constraints in healthcare (2017) Omega, 70, pp. 1-14; Dorigo, M., Stützle, T., Ant colony optimization: Overview and recent advances (2010) Handbook of Metaheuristics, pp. 227-263. , M.

This paper presents a mathematical model to design an enhanced ridesharing system with meet points and users’ preferable time windows. The introduction of meet points allows ridesharing operators to trade off the benefits of saving en-route delays and the cost of additional walking for some passengers to be collectively picked up or dropped off. This extension to the traditional door-to-door ridesharing problem brings more operation flexibility in urban areas (where potential requests may be densely distributed in neighborhood), and thus could achieve better system performance in terms of reducing the total travel time and increasing the served passengers. We design and implement a Tabu-based meta-heuristic algorithm to solve the proposed mixed integer linear program (MILP). To evaluate the validation and effectiveness of the proposed model and solution algorithm, several scenarios are designed and also resolved to optimality by CPLEX. Results demonstrate that (i) detailed route plan associated with passenger assignment to meet points can be obtained with en-route delay savings; (ii) as compared to CPLEX, the meta-heuristic algorithm bears the advantage of higher computation efficiency and produces good quality solutions with 8%~15% difference from the global optima; and (iii) introducing meet points to ridesharing system saves the total travel time by 2.7%-3.8% for small-scale ridesharing systems. More benefits are expected for ridesharing systems with large size of fleet. This study provides a new tool to efficiently operate the ridesharing system, particularly when the ride sharing vehicles are in short supply during peak hours. Traffic congestion mitigation will also be expected. © 2018 Li et al.

This work studies the experimental implementation of an on-demand public bus transportation service in Trikala, a medium-sized Greek city. With a view to optimize the service from both the operator's and the citizens' point of view, this paper presents an insertion heuristic solving the static multivehicle dial-a-ride problem with time windows and a fixed fleet of vehicles. Since viability of such a service depends on its ability of involving a significant number of users and getting reliable information, we tested a gamification layer, aimed at motivating public transport users to participate and behave correctly with the system. We present and discuss a novel pervasive computing architecture and various types of serious games designed to achieve these goals. We finally report early usability test results and some simulation-based indications on the design of city-scale deployable serious games to enhance public transport-based mobility. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","Dial-a-ride problem; elastic mobility; flexible public transport services; serious game","Buses; Computer architecture; Computer games; Fleet operations; Mass transportation; Serious games; Transportation; Ubiquitous computing; Dial-a-ride problem; Fleet of vehicles; Pervasive computing architectures; Public transport; Public transport service; Time deviation; Transportation services; Usability tests; Bus transportation",,,,,"Rietveld, P., Bruinsma, F.R., Van Vuuren, D.J., Coping with unreliability in public transport chains: A case study for Netherlands (2001) Transp.

This research aims to design mass customized services that provide multiple types of paratransit service through better system design and optimization of vehicle resources. In this paper, we focus on integrating scheduler route (SR) service with dial-a-ride (DAR) service, along with the option of a shared ride program. In the first part, we study how different types of paratransit services can be represented systematically under the same family structure. The identified commonality of processes among different service types will lead to the optimization of vehicle scheduling. Then, in the second part, we will develop a mechanism for scheduling vehicles to serve different types of passengers. Illustrated in a numerical example, 20% more passengers could be served by the integrated model of two service types. © 2017 IEEE.","Service design; service product family; vehicle routing and scheduling","Product design; Scheduling; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Customized services; Design and optimization; Different services; Integrated modeling; Paratransit services; Service design; Service products; Vehicle routing and scheduling; Fleet operations",,,,,"(2007) World Population Ageing 2007', , http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/WPA2007/wpp2007.htm, United Nations; (2012) Rejected Cases Rose to 1. 6 Thousand', , http://www.lfa.org.hk/todayhk_transport_en.php?aid=86, Hong Kong Fedration of Handicapped Youth; Johnson, M.P., (2012) Community-Based Operations Research, , New York: Springer; Aguilar-Saven, R.S., Business process modeling: Review and framework (2004) International Journal of Production Economics, 90 (2), pp. 129-149; Tseng, M.M., Jiao, J., Design for mass customization (1996) Annals of the CIRP, 45 (1), pp. 153-156; Silveria, G.D., Borenstein, D., Mass customization: Literature review and research directions (2001) International Journal of Production Economics, 72 (1), pp. 1-13; Tseng, M.M., Piller, F.T., (2003) The Customer Centric Enterprise: Advances in Mass Customization and Personalization, , Berlin, Hong Kong: Springer; Meyer, M., Lehnerd, A.P., (1997) The Power of Product Platform-Building Value and Cost Leadership, , New York: Free Press; Ulrich, K., Eppinger, S.D., (1995) Product Design and Development, , New York: McGraw Hill; Aguilar-Saven, R.S., Business process modeling: Review and framework (2002) International Journal of Production Economics, 90 (2), pp. 129-149; Zeithaml, V.A., Jo Bitner, M., (1996) Service Marketing, , New York: McGraw-Hill; Chou, H.H., Wang, Y., Tseng, M.M., Chieng, C.C., Dynamic service product family for mass service customization (2013) International Journal of Innovative Research in Science, Engineering and Technology, 2 (11), pp. 6575-6585; Johnson, M.P., Smilowitz, K., Secomandi, N., Community-based operations research (2007) Tutorials in Operations Research: Models, Methods and Applications for Innovative Decision Making, pp. 102-123. , Hanover, MD: Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences; Desrosiers, J., Dumas, Y., Solomon, M., Soumis, F., Time constrained routing and scheduling (1995) Handbooks in Operations Research and Management Science, pp. 35-139. , Amsterdam: Elsevier Science, Network Routing; Toth, P., Vigo, D., Fast local search algorithms for the handicapped persons transportation problem (1996) Meta-Heuristics: Theory and Applications, pp. 677-690. , Boston: Springer US; Toth, P., Vigo, D., Heuristic algorithms for the handicapped persons transportation problem (1997) Transportation Science, 31, pp. 60-71; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research B, 37 (6), pp. 579-594; Madsen, O., Ravn, H., Rygaard, J., A heuristic algorithm for the a dial-a-ride problem with time windows, multiple capacities, and multiple objectives (1995) Annals of Operations Research, 60, pp. 193-208; Jaw, J., Odoni, A., Psaraftis, H., Wilson, N., A heuristic algorithm for the multi-vehicle advance request dial-a-ride problem with time windows (1986) Transportation Research B, 20, pp. 243-257; Mo, D.Y., Lee, Y.C.E., Wang, Y., Cheung, T.K.Y., Shared dial-a-ride service for more people with lower price (2017) Transportation Research Board (Ed.), Compendium of Papers, ID: 17-00205",,,"","IEEE Computer Society","2017 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management, IEEM 2017","10 December 2017 through 13 December 2017",,134633,21573611,9781538609484,,,"English","IEEE Int.

Commonly, it arises in door-to-door transportation for impaired or elderly people. The main objective is to accommodate as many users as possible with a minimum operation cost. It adds realistic precedence and transit time constraints on the pairing of vehicles and customers. This paper proposes a hybrid evolutionary heuristic for the dial-a-ride problem with time windows (DARPTW). It combines evolutionary crossover operators with a hybridized VNS algorithm. Data extracted from routes with DARP infeasibilities are used to guide customized local search operators. Using route duration minimization as its main objective, the competitiveness of the proposed heuristic is tested on benchmark instances. © 2017 IEEE.","Dial-A-Ride Problem; Evolutionary heuristic; Tabu Search; Time Windows; Variable Neighborhood Search","Benchmarking; Tabu search; Vehicle routing; Crossover operator; Dial-a-ride problem; Evolutionary heuristic; Local search operators; Pickup and delivery; Time windows; Transit time constraints; Variable neighborhood search; Artificial intelligence",,,,,"Attanasio, A., Cordeau, J.F., Ghiani, G., Laporte, G., Parallel tabu search heuristics for the dynamic multi-vehicle dial-A-ride problem (2004) Parallel Computing, 30 (3), pp. 377-387; Belhaiza, S., Hansen, P., Laporte, G., Hybrid variable neighborhood tabu Search heuristic for the vehicle routing problem with multiple time windows (2014) Computers &Operations Research, 52, pp. 269-281; Belhaiza, S., M'Hallah, R., A Pareto non-dominated solution approach for the vehicle routing Problem with multiple time windows Proceedings of the 2016 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation CEC, 2016, pp. 3515-3524; Belhaiza, S., M'Hallah, R., Ben Brahim, G., A new hybrid genetic variable neighborhood search heuristic for the vehicle routing problem with multiple time windows (2017) Proceedings of the 2017 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation CEC, pp. 1319-1326; Belhaiza, S., A game theoretic approach for the real-life multiple-criterion vehicle routing problem with multiple time windows (2017) IEEE Systems Journal; Braekers, K., Caris, A., Janssens, G.K., Exact and meta-heuristic approach for a general heterogeneous dial-A-ride problem with multiple depots (2014) Transport Research Part B: Methodological, 67, p. 16686; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multivehicle dial-A-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B, 37, pp. 579-594; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., The dial-A-ride Problem: Models and algorithms (2007) Annals of Operations Research, 153, pp. 29-46; Chevrier, R., Liefooghe, A., Jourdan, L., Dhaenens, C., Solving a diala-ride problem with a hybrid evolutionary multi-objective approach: Application to demand responsive transport (2012) Applied Soft Computing, 12, pp. 1247-1258; Glover, F., Future paths for integer programming and links to artificial intelligence (1986) Computers &Operations Research, 13, pp. 533-549; Guerreiro, F., Pezzella, F., Pisacane, O., Trollini, L., Multi-objective optimization in dial-A-ride public transportation (2014) Transportation Research Procedia, 3, pp. 299-308; Holland, J.H., Adaptation in natural and artificial systems (1975) University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor; Kirchner, D., Calvo, R.W., A granular tabu search algorithm for the diala-ride problem (2013) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 56, pp. 120-135; Liu, M., Luo, Z., Lim, A., Hybridization of harmony search with variable neighborhood search for restrictive single-machine earliness/tardiness problem (2013) Information Sciences, 226, pp. 68-92; Obg, M., Raven, H.F., Rygaard, J.M., A branch-and-cut algorithm for a realistic dial-A-ride problem (2015) Transportation Research Part B, 81, pp. 267-288; Ma, M., Braekers, K., Masmoudi, M., Dammak, A., A hybrid genetic algorithm for the heterogeneous dial-A-ride problem (2017) Computers &Operations Research, 81, pp. 1-13; Masson, R., Lehude, F., Peton, O., The dial-A-ride problem with transfer (2013) Computers &Operations Research, 41, pp. 12-23; Markovic, N., Kim, M., Schonfeld, P., Statistical and machine learning approach for planning dial-A-ride systems (2016) Transportation Research Part A, 89, pp. 41-55; Mladenovic, N., Hansen, P., Variable neighborhood search (1997) Computers &Operations Research, 24, pp. 1097-1100; Muelas, S., LaTorre, A., Pena, J.-M., A distributed VNS algorithm for optimizing dial-A-ride problems in large-scale scenarios (2015) Transportation Research Part C, 54, pp. 110-130; Paquette, J., Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., Combining multicriteria analysis and tabu search for dial-A-ride problems (2013) Transportation Research B, 52, pp. 1-16; Parragh, S., Doerner, K., Hartl, R., Variable neighborhood search for the dial-A-ride problem (2010) Computers &Operations Research, 37, pp. 1129-1138; Parragh, S., Schmid, V., Hybrid large neighborhood search for the dial-aride problem (2013) Computers &Operations Research, 40, pp. 490-497; Zidi, I., Mesghouni, K., Zidi, K., Ghedira, K., A multi-objective simulated annealing for the multi-criteria dial a ride problem (2012) Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 25, pp. 1121-1131","Belhaiza, S.; Department of Mathematics and Statistics, King Fahd University of Petroleum and MineralsSaudi Arabia; email: slimb@kfupm.edu.sa",,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2017 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence, SSCI 2017","27 November 2017 through 1 December 2017",,134337,,9781538627259,,,"English","IEEE Symp.

In this work, a static multi-vehicle case of DARP is considered where routes of multiple vehicles are designed to serve customer requests which are known a priori. DARP necessitates the need of high quality algorithm to provide optimal feasible solutions. We employ an improved ACO algorithm called ant colony system (ACS) to solve DARP. The fleet minimisation is also achieved by using ACS. In summary, multiple ACS are employed to minimise the fleet size while generating feasible solutions for DARP.

In this paper, we look at optimization procedures which appear as subroutines in dynamic problems and show how discrete event simulation can be used to assess the quality of algorithms: after establishing a general link between online optimization and discrete event systems, we address performance measurement in dynamic settings and derive a corresponding tool kit. We then analyze several control strategies using the methodologies discussed previously in two real world examples of discrete event simulation models: a manual order picking system and a pickup and delivery service. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Algorithm analysis; Discrete event simulation; Online optimization; Order picking; Pickup and delivery",,,,,,"Angelopoulos, S., Dorrigiv, R., López-Ortiz, A., On the separation and equivalence of paging strategies (2007) Proceedings of the 18th annual ACM-SIAM symposium on discrete algorithms, pp. 229-237; Becchetti, L., Leonardi, S., Marchetti-Spaccamela, A., Schäfer, G., Vredeveld, T., Average-case and smoothed competitive analysis of the multilevel feedback algorithm (2006) Math Oper Res, 31 (1), pp. 85-108; Ben-David, S., Borodin, A., A new measure for the study of on-line algorithms (1994) Algorithmica, 11 (1), pp. 73-91; Blom, M., Krumke, S., de Paepe, W., Stougie, L., The online TSP against fair adversaries (2000) Algorithms and complexit, pp. 137-149. , Bongiovanni G, Petreschi R, Gambosi G, (eds), Springer, Berlin; Borodin, A., El-Yaniv, R., (1998) Online computation and competitive analysis, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Boyar, J., Favrholdt, L., (2007) The relative worst order ratio for online algorithms.

In the standard problem, operational costs are minimized, subject to full demand satisfaction and service level requirements. However, to enhance the practical applicability of solution methods, authors increasingly focus on problem variants that adopt additional real-life characteristics. First, this work introduces an up-to-date classification that distinguishes multiple categories of real-life characteristics. Second, the wide range of solution methods proposed in the literature is reviewed in a structured manner. Although the existing literature is reviewed exhaustively, specific attention is devoted to recent developments. Third, an extensive overview table provides full details on all problem characteristics and solution methods applied in each paper discussed. Fourth, lacunae in research conducted to date and opportunities for future work are identified. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Demand-responsive transportation; Dial-a-ride; Literature review;

Recently, demand responsive transportation(DRT) services have been proposed for the first/last mile transit. However, in contrast to the requirements of a public transportation system, existing DRT services either match only a few passengers to a vehicle or require advance booking. Hence, in this paper we propose a DRT system, specifically for the First mile transit, by matching multiple passengers to a vehicle in real-time. We first model the problem as a convergent graph and obtain an exact solution. Next, a scalable heuristic algorithm has been proposed that not only provides near optimal solution, but also does that in real-time (≈ms) as opposed to minutes/hours taken for the exact solution. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Mass transportation; Exact solution; First mile; Near-optimal solutions; Public transport; Public transportation systems; Real time; Time spent; Heuristic algorithms",,,,,"Logan, S., (2016) First and Last Mile Connections: New Mobility, , http://on.nrdc.org/2utPxUd, 16) 10; Floudas, N., Public transport optimisation based on traveller requests and network efficiency (2014) RTIC; SpencerWoodman, (2016) WELCOMETOUBERVILLE, , http://bit.ly/2uwXd6e; Lim, P., (2016) GrabShare Vs uberPOOL Which Carpooling App Is Best (17) for Singaporeans?, , http://bit.ly/2tWudTx; (2017) Beeline Singapore, , https://www.beeline.sg/; Final Report on The Kutsuplus Trial: Work to Develop Ride-Pooling Worth Continuing, , http://bit.ly/2h01gVz; Sulopuisto, O., (2016) Why Helsinki’S Innovative on-Demand Bus Service Failed, , http://bit.ly/1VXDDqu; King, D.A., (2016) What Do We Know About The First Mile/Last Mile Problem for Transit?, , http://bit.ly/2e1nKVk; Zhang, D., Last-mile transit service with urban infrastructure data (2016) ACM Trans.

This new problem consists in defining a solution of RCPSPR that considers both routing and scheduling and that complies with a RCPSP flow, i.e., a solution where the loaded vehicle moves are achieved between activity i and j with a non-null flow. A shortest path algorithm is proposed to solve this problem with a labeling dynamic approach where a label provides all of the information about a solution, including the objective function, the system state and the remaining resources that allow the use of a dominance rule. The system state, described by the label, encompasses both the activities and the vehicle fleet information, including vehicle position and availability dates. Numerical experiments are limited to a comparative study with a proposed linear formulation since no previous publications exist on this problem. A time performance analysis of the proposed algorithm is carried out, proving the efficiency of the algorithm and clearing the way for integration into global iterative optimization schemes that will solve the RCPSPR to optimality. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Arc routing; RCPSP; Routing; Scheduling","Fleet operations; Graph theory; Iterative methods; Optimization; Routing algorithms; Scheduling; Vehicles; Arc routing; Iterative Optimization; Numerical experiments; RCPSP; Resource-constrained project scheduling problem; Routing; Routing and scheduling; Shortest path algorithms; Problem solving",,,,,"Adnen, E.A., Mohsen, E., An efficient new heuristic for the hoist scheduling problem (2016) Computers & Operations Research, 67, pp. 184-192; Afsar, H.M., Lacomme, P., Ren, L., Prodhon, C., Vigo, D., Resolution of a job-shop problem with transportation constraints: A master/slave approach (2016) IFAC, 49 (12), pp. 898-903; Alvarez-Valdés, R., Tamarit, J.M., The project scheduling prolyhedron: Dimension, facets and lifting theorems (1993) European Journal of Operational Research, 67, pp. 204-220; Artigues, C., Michelon, P., Reusser, S., Insertion for static and dynamic RCPSP (2003) European Journal of Operational Research, 149, pp. 249-267; Caumond, A., Lacomme, P., Moukrim, A., Tchernev, N., An MILP for scheduling problems in a FMS with one vehicle (2009) European Journal of Operational Research, 199 (3), pp. 706-722; Cheng, R., Gen, M., Tsujimura, Y., A tutorial survey of job-shop scheduling problems using genetic algorithms – I representation (1996) Computers and Industrial Engineering, 30, pp. 983-997; Chtourou, S., Manier, M.-A., Loukil, T., A hybrid algorithm for the cyclic hoist scheduling problem with two transportation resources (2013) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 65 (3), pp. 426-437; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B Methodology, 37, pp. 579-594; Dauzère-Pérès, S., Lasserre, J.B., (1995), A new mixed-integer formulation of the flow-shop sequencing problem.

This paper investigates the operational effects of horizontal cooperation among dial-a-ride providers. The current practice is that users choose a particular provider to submit their requests. Providers operating in the same area create their routing solutions independently of each other, given their own set of customers. In contrast, horizontal cooperation through joint route planning implies that customer requests can be exchanged among providers in order to minimize the overall routing cost. In addition to quantifying the operational benefits generated by such a horizontal cooperation, this paper identifies operational characteristics that influence the magnitude of the savings. A real-life case study reveals the reasons why providers benefit from certain request exchanges, as well as the extent to which these exchanges are predictable in advance. The solutions are obtained using a large neighborhood search algorithm that performs well on benchmark data. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Demand-responsive transportation; Dial-a-ride services; Horizontal cooperation; Joint route planning",,,,,,"Anderson, D., Sweeney, D., Williams, T., Freeman, J., Shoesmith, E., Statistics for Business and Economics (2010), CENGAGE Learning Business Press; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Dynamic pickup and delivery problems (2010) Euro.

We propose and study here several network flow oriented models and algorithms which deal with a static version of this problem while unifying preemption and non preemption as well as carrier riding cost, vehicle riding time and carrier number minimization. Those network flow models are vehicle driven, which means that they focus on the way vehicles are exchanged between excess and deficit stations. We perform a lower bound and approximation analysis which leads us to the design and test of several heuristics.

The general idea of Taxi-ridesharing is that drivers and riders use mobile phones connected to a web service to arrange rides. In this paper we propose a taxi-ridesharing service that reduces the total travelling distance per taxi and travelling cost per person significantly. In our method, we first use Taxi searching algorithm to quickly retrieve taxis that are likely to satisfy a user query. After this step, we have proposed a scheduling algorithm with time-window which reduces the total distance travelled by the taxi. We have evaluated our algorithms using trajectory dataset of 20 taxis. This analysis has helped to know how various ridesharing systems could affect the transportation service. © 2017 IEEE.","formatting; insert; style; styling","Cost reduction; Scheduling algorithms; Taxicabs; Technology transfer; Web services; formatting; insert; Ride-sharing; Searching algorithms; style; styling; Total distances; Transportation services; Cellular telephone systems",,,,,"Baldacci, R., Maniezzo, V., Mingozzi, A., (2004) An Exact Method for the Car Pooling Problem Based on Lagrangean Column Generation, 52, pp. 422-439; Beaudry, A., Laporte, G., Melo, S.T., (2010) Nickel Dynamic Transportation of Patients in Hospitals or Spectrum; Benetis, R., Jensen, S., Karciauskas, G., (2006) And Simonas Saltenis Nearest and Reverse Nearest Neighbor Queries for Moving Objects the VLDB Journal, 15 (3), pp. 229-249; Calvo, R.W., Colorni, A., An Effective and Fast Heuristic for the Dial A Ride Problem; Calvo, R.W., De Luigi, F., Haastrup, P., Maniezzo, V., A distributed geographic information system for the daily carpooling problem Computer Operation Research (2004) Elsevier Science Ltd.; Colorni, A., Righini, G., (2001) Modeling and Optimizing Dynamic Dial-aride ProblemsInternational Transactions in Operational Research; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., (2003) A Tabu Search Heuristic for the Static Multi-vehicle Dial-a-ride Problem Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 37, pp. 579-594. , July; Cordeau, J.F., (2006) A Branch-and-cut Algorithm for the Dial-aride Problem Operation Research; Delling, D., Goldberg, A.V., Werneck, R.F., Werneck, R.F., (2011) Faster Batched Shortest Paths in Road Networks ATMOS, 20, pp. 52-63. , Germany; Desrochers, M., Lenstra, J., Savelsbergh, M., Soumis, F., (1988) Vehicle Routing with Time Windows: Optimization and Approximation Vehicle Routing: Methods and Studies, , Amsterdam; Orey, P.D., Fernandes, R., (2010) Empirical Evaluation of A Dynamic and Distributed Taxi-sharing System in IEEE Conf. on Intelligent Transporta-tion Systems, 1. , September; Dumas, Y., Desrosiers, J., Soumis, F., (1991) The Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows European Journal of Operational Research, 54, pp. 7-22. , Elsevier, September; Ge, Y., Xiong, H., Tuzhilin, A., Xiao, K., Gruteser, M., Pazzani, M., (2010) An Energy-efficient Mobile Recommender System in KDD",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","4th International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communication Systems, ICACCS 2017","6 January 2017 through 7 January 2017",,130103,,9781509045594,,,"English","Int.

The demand-adaptive service connects passengers from their origin/destination to the fixed-route service in order to improve accessability. The proposed hybrid design is unique in that it operates the demand-adaptive service with a stable headway to cover all stops along a paired fixed-route line. Pairing demand-adaptive vehicles with a fixed-route line simplifies the complexity of on-demand routing, because the vehicles can follow a more predictable path and can be dispatched on intervals coordinated with the fixed-route line. The design of the two services are closely coupled to minimize the total system cost, which incudes both the transit agency's operating cost and the user cost. The optimal design model is formulated as a mixed integer program and solved using a commercially available metaheuristic. Numerical experiments are conducted to compare the demand adaptive paired-line hybrid transit (DAPL-HT) system with two related transit systems that may be considered its special cases: a fixed-route system and a flexible-route system. We show that the DAPL-HT system outperforms the other two systems under a wide range of demand levels and in various scenarios of input parameters. A discrete-event simulation model is also developed and applied to confirm the correctness of the analytical results. © 2017","Demand adaptive service; Discrete-event simulation; Fixed-route service; Hybrid transit system","Costs; Integer programming; Mass transportation; Adaptive services; Analytical results; Discrete-event simulation model; Fixed-route service; Mixed-integer programs; Numerical experiments; Optimal design model; Transit systems; Discrete event simulation; analytical method; cost analysis; demand analysis; service quality; simulation; transportation system",,,,,"Aldaihani, M.M., Quadrifoglio, L., Dessouky, M.M., Hall, R., Network design for a grid hybrid transit service (2004) Transp.

A mixed integer nonlinear programming model was firstly formulated for the considered problem. To make the MHDARP-FD tractable, the original model was reformulated by linearizing constraints, aggregating variables, and strengthening model.

In this system, users rent cars and may leave them anywhere on a designated area. After a while, a set of vehicles must be relocated to a discrete set of weighted spots, where other users may rent them again. In order to do it, some shuttles drive a set of operators to vehicles to be relocated and then collect the operators back. The objective is to maximize the weighted sum of served spots on a given time. The ILP model could solve the small instances and gave an upper (UB) and a lower bound (LB) for the others. The UB and LB values were used to evaluate the solution found by EA and showed that EA indeed found good solutions, even optimal ones. © 2017 IEEE.",,,,,,,"Herbawi, W., Knoll, M., Kaiser, M., Gruel, W., An evolutionary algorithm for the vehicle relocation problem in free floating carsharing (2016) 2016 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC), pp. 2873-2879; Savelsbergh, M.W., Sol, M., The general pickup and delivery problem (1995) Transportation Science, 29 (1), pp. 17-29; Herbawi, W., Weber, M., Modeling the multihop ridematching problem with time windows and solving it using genetic algorithms (2012) Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI), 2012 IEEE 24th International Conference on, 1, pp. 89-96. , IEEE; Jaw, J.-J., Odoni, A.R., Psaraftis, H.N., Wilson, N.H., A heuristic algorithm for the multi-vehicle advance request dial-a-ride problem with time windows (1986) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 20 (3), pp. 243-257; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multivehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 37 (6), pp. 579-594; Hansen, P., Mladenovíc, N., Variable neighborhood search: Principles and applications (2001) European Journal of Operational Research, 130 (3), pp. 449-467; (2017) Planet Dump, , http://www.openstreetmap.org, OpenStreetMap contributors, http: //planet. osm. org; (2017) Graphhopper Matrix Api, , https://graphhopper.com/, GraphHopper, Website, last checked: 01. 30; Balardino, A.F., Dos Santos, A.G., Ridematching for a common destination with close enough attendance (2016) 2016 IEEE 19th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC), pp. 1863-1868. , Nov",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2017 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation, CEC 2017","5 June 2017 through 8 June 2017",,129053,,9781509046010,,,"English","IEEE Congr.

A hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) is proposed to solve the problem. Efficient construction heuristics, crossover operators and local search techniques, specifically tailored to the characteristics of the H-DARP, are provided. The proposed algorithm is tested on 92 benchmarks instances and 40 newly introduced larger instances. Computational experiments show the effectiveness of our approach compared to the current state-of-the-art algorithms for the DARP and H-DARP. When tested on the existing instances, we achieved average gaps of only 0.47% to the best-known solutions for the DARP, and 0.05% to the optimal solutions for the H-DARP, compared to 0.85% and 0.10%, respectively, obtained by the current state-of-the-art algorithms. For the 40 newly generated instances, average gaps of the hybrid GA are 0.35% smaller compared to the current state-of-the-art method. Besides, our method provides best results for 31 of these instances and ties with the existing method on 8 other instances. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Construction heuristics; Genetic Algorithm (GA); Heterogeneous Dial-A-Ride Problem (H-DARP); Hybrid algorithm; Local Search (LS)","Fleet operations; Local search (optimization); Problem solving; Transportation routes; Computational experiment; Construction heuristics; Dial-a-ride problem; Hybrid algorithms; Hybrid genetic algorithms; Local search; State-of-the-art algorithms; State-of-the-art methods; Genetic algorithms",,,,,"Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., Dynamic pickup and delivery problems (2010) Eur J Operat Res, 202 (1), pp. 8-15; Blanton, J.L., Jr, Wainwright, R.L., Multiple vehicle routing with time and capacity constraints using genetic algorithms (1993) Proceedings of the 5th international conference on genetic algorithms, pp. 452-459. , Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc; Borndorfer, R., Grotschel, M., Klostermeiner, F., Kuttner, C., Telebus Berlin: vehicle routing scheduling in a dial a ride system (1997), Konrad Zuse Zentrum für Information Technik Berlin; Braekers, K., Caris, A., Janssens, G.K., Exact and meta-heuristic approach for a general heterogeneous dial-a-ride problem with multiple depots (2014) Transport Res Part B: Methodological, 67, pp. 166-186; Buro, M., Experiments with Multi-ProbCut and a new high-quality evaluation function for Othello (1997) Games in AI Research, pp. 77-96; Chassaing, M., Duhamel, C., Lacomme, P., An ELS-based approach with dynamic probabilities management in local search for the Dial-A-Ride Problem (2016) Eng Appl Artif Intell, 48, pp. 119-133; Cao, E., Lai, M., An improved differential evolution algorithm for the vehicle routing problem with simultaneous delivery and pick-up service (2007) Third international conference on natural computation (ICNC 2007), 3, pp. 436-440. , IEEE; Choi, I.C., Kim, S.I., Kim, H.S., A genetic algorithm with a mixed region search for the asymmetric traveling salesman problem (2003) Comput Operat Res, 30 (5), pp. 773-786; Cordeau, J.F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operat Res, 54 (3), pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transport Res Part B: Methodological, 37 (6), pp. 579-594; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem: models and algorithms (2007) Ann Operat Res, 153 (1), pp. 29-46; Cubillos, C., Rodriguez, N., Crawford, B., A study on genetic algorithms for the DARP problem (2007) International work-conference on the interplay between natural and artificial computation, pp. 498-507. , Springer Berlin Heidelberg; Doerner, K., Salazar-Gonzalez, J., Vehicle routing: problems, methods, and applications, second edition.

To conduct a meaningful comparison, the optimal design problems for both systems are formulated using a same analytical framework based on the continuous approximation approach. A comprehensive numerical experiment is performed to compare various cost components corresponding to the optimal designs, and a discrete-event simulation model is developed to validate the analysis. The analytical and simulation results agree with each other well, with a discrepancy in the total system cost less than 5% in most test scenarios. These results also suggest that the line-based system consistently outperforms the zone-based system in terms of both agency and user costs, for all scenarios tested. Compared to the zone-based design, the line-based design features a sparser fixed-route network (resulting in larger stop spacing) but a higher dispatching frequency. It is concluded that the higher efficiency of the line-based design is likely derived from the strategy of operating e-hailing vehicles with a more regular route/headway structure and allowing ride-sharing. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Continuous approximation; Discrete-event simulation; E-hailing service; Fixed-route service; Relative spatial position","Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Light rail transit; Mass transportation; Optimal systems; Vehicles; Continuous approximations; Design features; Discrete-event simulation model; Fixed-route service; Higher efficiency; Numerical experiments; Spatial positions; Transit systems; Discrete event simulation; computer simulation; spatial analysis; transportation system",,,,,"Aldaihani, M.M., Quadrifoglio, L., Dessouky, M.M., Hall, R., Network design for a grid hybrid transit service (2004) Transp.

Quality is ensured by taking into account service level requirements. However, little research has been conducted into the effect of service level variations on operational costs incurred by service providers. This study investigates the evolution of operational costs for 78 combinations of two service level parameters, being the maximum deviation from a user’s preference time and the relative maximum exceedance of a user’s direct ride time. A distinction is made between various operating circumstances, including the size of the service provider, the traffic conditions in the service area and the heterogeneity of the customers. The resulting tradeoffs between quality and costs should encourage service providers to make informed decisions regarding potential changes in the service level they offer. The sensitivity analysis in this paper is performed on well-known benchmark data from literature and applies a state-of-the-art deterministic annealing metaheuristic to compute operational costs. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Demand-responsive transportation; Deterministic annealing; Dial-a-ride; Operational costs; Service level",,,,,,"Anderson, D.R., Sweeney, D.J., Williams, T.A., Freeman, J., Shoesmith, E., (2010) Statistics for business and economics, , CENGAGE Learning Business Press, Boston; Ben-Akiva, M., Benjamin, J., Lauprete, G.J., Polydoropoulou, A., Impact of advanced public transportation systems on travel by dial-a-ride (1996) Transp Res Rec, 1557, pp. 72-79; Braekers, K., Caris, A., Janssens, G.K., Exact and meta-heuristic approach for a general heterogeneous dial-a-ride problem with multiple depots (2014) Transp Res Part B: Methodol, 67, pp. 166-186; Cordeau, J.-F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Oper Res, 54 (3), pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J.-F., Gendreau, M., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for periodic and multi-depot vehicle routing problems (1997) Networks, 30, pp. 105-119; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transp Res Part B: Methodol, 37 (6), pp. 579-594; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem: models and algorithms (2007) Ann Oper Res, 153 (1), pp. 29-46; Cubillos, C., Paolo, F., Mascia, M., Zunino, C., On user requirements and operator purposes in dial-a-ride services (2002) Proceedings of the 9th meeting of the EURO working group on transportation; Jaw, J.-J., Odoni, A.R., Psaraftis, H.N., Wilson, N.H.M., A heuristic algorithm for the multi-vehicle advance-request dial-a-ride problem with time windows (1986) Transp Res Part B: Methodol, 20, pp. 243-257; Lin, S., Kernighan, B.W., An effective heuristic algorithm for the traveling salesman problem (1973) Oper Res, 21 (2), pp. 498-516; Marković, N., Nair, R., Schonfeld, P., Miller-Hooks, E., Mohebbi, M., Optimizing dial-a-ride services in maryland.

The operator aims at constructing cheap itineraries while minimizing customer inconvenience. This problem has been studied as the Dial-a-Ride Problem (DARP), which consists of both spatial and temporal factors. This article studies the impact of spatial and temporal variation on multivehicle DARP using route construction heuristics. Our work highlights the impact of these variations on the customer disutility and transportation cost. The study will help the service operators in selecting an appropriate construction heuristic while expanding the DARP service in terms of service area, service duration, or planning for a sudden growth in the number of customers. The results show that if the operator is planning to expand the area of service, the Saving Heuristic is more appropriate for larger operators while Insertion Heuristic with spatial sorting scheme is better for smaller operators with limited number of vehicles.

A two-step approach for resource-optimal sensor scheduling has been developed in close cooperation with subject matter experts from the military ISR domain. It consists of a pre-selection step where, for each target, the set of available assets being principally suited is determined. In the second step, an automatic planning component tries to derive concrete proposals which assets have to be finally assigned to which targets and for the dedicated routes individual assets have to follow in order to serve these targets. The pre-selection step is realized as interactive step and based on the concept of a chain of filters in which individual filters work independently from each other on the set of available assets. The automatic planning component is based on a combinatorial optimization problem being solved using a dedicated meta-heuristic approach. The two-step approach for resource-optimal sensor scheduling constitutes the essential basis of a computer-aided assistance system for ISR management personal which has been implemented as a demonstrator. Coming from a military context, the described concepts and solutions also apply to civil applications with similar requirements. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Combinatorial optimization; Computer resource management; Heuristic methods; Intelligent systems; Military applications; Optimization; Assistance system; Automatic planning; Civil applications; Combinatorial optimization problems; Intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissances; Meta-heuristic approach; Subject matter experts; Two-step approach; Scheduling",,,,,"(2012) Collection Coordination and Intelligence Requirements Management (CCIRM) Handbook, , NATO Allied Command Transformation May; Biermann, J., Remarks on resource management in intelligence (2006) Pro-ceedings of the 9th International Conference on Information Fusion, , IEEE; (2012) Joint and National Intelligence Support to Military Operations, , DoD Joint Publication 2-01 January; (2005) NATO Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Interoperability Architecture (NIA) Volume 1: Architecture Description, , AFAG, AEDP-2 Vol. 1 Ed. 1 September; Essendorfer, B., Kerth, C., Zaschke, C., Evolution of the coalition shared data concept in joint isr (2015) Proceedings of the NATO IST/SET-126 Symposium on Information Fusion (Hard and Soft) for Intelligence, Surveillance & Reconnaissance (ISR), Joint Symposium IST-106 and SET-189; Katsilieris, F., Charlish, A., Boers, Y., Towards an online, adaptive algorithm for radar surveillance control (2012) Proceedings of the 2012 IEEE ISIF GI Workshop on Sensor Data Fusion; Beck, J.C., Prosser, P., Selensky, E., Graph transformations for the vehicle routing and job shop scheduling problems (2002) Graph Transformation, Proceedings of the First International Conference (ICGT), pp. 60-74. , Springer; Beck, J.C., Prosser, P., Selensky, E., Vehicle routing and job shop scheduling: Whats the difference?

The primary goal of the company is to minimize its operational costs while fulfilling the orders under the constraints on time window, duration, carrier capacity and ride time. This problem is formulated as the real-world DARP, and two methods are empirically evaluated by using Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) frameworks. The experiments are done on the simulated data provided by the company. The results show that a heuristic approach is more suitable for the real-world problem to meet the time window limitations. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Combinatorial optimization; Dial-a-Ride Problem; Genetic Algorithm; Mixed integer programming; Transportation","Combinatorial optimization; Evolutionary algorithms; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Optimization; Transportation; Dial-a-ride problem; Empirical analysis; Heuristic approach; Mixed integer programming; Mixed integer programming (MIP); Optimization method; Real-world problem; Start-up companies; Integer programming",,,,,"Baugh, J.W., Jr., Kakivaya, G.K.R., Stone, J.R., Intractability of the dial-a-ride problem and a multiobjective solution using simulated annealing (1998) Eng.

This is the underlying winner determination problem in an online auction-based vehicle sharing platform that matches transportation demand and supply, particularly in a B2B last-mile setting. Each shipper bid contains multiple jobs, and each job has a weight, volume, pickup location, delivery location and time window. On the other hand, each transporter bid specifies the vehicle capacity, available time periods, and a cost structure. This double-sided auction will be cleared by the platform to find a profit-maximizing match and corresponding routes while respecting shipper and transporter constraints. Compared to the classical pickup-and-delivery problem, a key challenge is the dependency among jobs, more precisely, all jobs within a shipper bid must either be accepted or rejected together and jobs within a bid may be assigned to different transporters. We formulate the mathematical model and propose an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search approach to solve the problem heuristically. We also derive management insights obtained from our computational experiments. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Logistics; Pickup-and-delivery problem with jobs dependency; Winner determination problem","Heuristic algorithms; Logistics; Optimization; Pickups; Profitability; Ships; Adaptive large neighborhood searches; Combinatorial auction; Computational experiment; Double sided auctions; Pickup and delivery problems; Sharing platforms; Transportation demand; Winner determination problem; Problem solving",,,,,"Ledyard, J.O., Olson, M., Porter, D., Swanson, J.A., Torma, D.P., The first use of a combined-value auction for transportation services (2002) Interfaces, 32 (5), pp. 4-12; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 37 (6), pp. 579-594; Li, H., Lim, A., A metaheuristic for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2003) International Journal on Artificial Intelligence Tools, 12 (2), pp. 173-186; Ropke, S., Pisinger, D., An adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2006) Transportation Science, 40 (4), pp. 455-472; Mes, M., (2008) Sequential Auctions for Full Truckload Allocation.

This mode allows passengers to be carried to their destinations through a set of transportation requests established by customers. These requests are to be answered by a single depot with different vehicle configurations. The idea is to group a number of passengers in the same vehicle respecting of the capacity of each vehicle in order to reduce the operational cost while maintaining a good quality of service. In this paper, we treated the static case of demand responsive transport problem. A new mathematical model for this problem is presented aiming to optimise the cost and the quality of service. This model integrates an original concept; penalty concept to enhance the quality of service. The model is validated on small and medium size instances.

The aim of DARP is to design vehicle routes satisfying requests of users and minimizing the total traveled distance. In this work, we consider a real case of dynamic DARP service operated by Padam (www.padam.io) in Paris and Bristol. Padam offers a high quality transportation service in which users ask for a service either in real time or in advance, and get an immediate answer about whether their requests are accepted or not. The transport activity is outsourced in Padam’s service, and contracts are negotiated with third parties firms. Then each day, a fixed set of drivers is available during a working period of time to provide a transportation service of Padam. The main goal then becomes to maximize the number of accepted requests during the service. In this work, we develop a two-phase procedure to achieve it. In the first phase an insertion heuristic is used to quickly find out whether a request of a customer can be inserted, then, in the second phase, we run an ALNS algorithm between the occurrence of requests to improve the quality of the solution. The procedure was extensively tested on real data provided by Padam with up to 2000 requests and very tight side constraints and time-windows. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Computational experiments; Dynamic DARP; Insertion heuristic; Online heuristic","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Computational experiment; Dial-a-ride problem; Insertion heuristic; Online heuristic; Side constraints; Transport activity; Transport systems; Transportation services; Transportation",,,,,"Attanasio, A., Cordeau, J.-F., Ghiani, G., Laporte, G., Parallel tabu search heuristics for the dynamic multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2004) Parallel Computing, 30 (3), pp. 8-15; Beaudry, A., Laporte, G., Melo, T., Nickel, S., Dynamic transportation of patients in hospitals (2010) OR Spectrum, 32 (1), pp. 77-107; Ben-Ameur, W., Computing the initial temperature of simulated annealing (2004) Computational Optimization and Applications, 29, pp. 369-385; Birattari, M., (2009) Tuning Metaheuristics: A Machine Learning Perspective, , Springer; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 37 (6), pp. 579-594; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problems, models and algorithms (2007) Annals of Operations Research, 153, pp. 29-46; Coslovich, L., Pesenti, R., Ukovich, W., A two-phase insertion technique of unexpected customers for a dynamic dial-a-ride problem (2006) European Journal of Operational Research, 175 (3), pp. 1605-1615; Diana, M., Dessouky, M.M., A new regret insertion heuristic for solving large-scale dial-a-ride problems with time windows (2004) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 38 (6), pp. 539-557; Li, B., Krushinsky, D., Woensel, T.V., Reijers, H.A., An adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic for the share-a-ride problem (2016) Computers and Operations Research, 66, pp. 170-180; Li, Y., Chen, H., Prins, C., Adaptive large neighborhood search for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows, profits, and reserved requests (2016) European Journal of Operational Research, 252 (1), pp. 27-38; López-Ibáñez, M., Dubois-Lacoste, J., Cáceres, L.P., Birattari, M., Stützle, T., The irace package: Iterated racing for automatic algorithm configuration (2016) Operations Research Perspectives, 3, pp. 43-58; Madsen, O.B.G., Ravn, H.F., Rygaard, J.M., A heuristic algorithm for a dial-a-ride problem with time windows, multiple capacities, and multiple objectives (1995) Annals of Operations Research, 60 (1), pp. 193-208; Psaraftis, H., An exact algorithm for the single vehicle many-to-many dial-a-ride problem with time windows (1983) Transportation Science, 17 (3), pp. 351-357; Ropke, S., Pisinger, D., An adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2006) Transportation Science, 40 (4), pp. 455-472; Santos, D.O., Xavier, E.C., Taxi and ride sharing: A dynamic dial-a-ride problem with money as an incentive (2015) Expert Systems with Applications, 42 (19), pp. 6728-6737; Schilde, M., Doerner, K.F., Hartl, R.F., Metaheuristics for the dynamic stochastic dial-a-ride problem with expected return transports (2011) Computers and Operations Research, 38 (12), pp. 1719-1730; Wilson, N., Sussman, J., Wang, H., Higonnet, B., Scheduling algorithms for dial-a-ride systems (1971) Technical Report USL-TR-71-13","Vallée, S.; Université de Lorraine, Lorraine Research Laboratory in Computer Science and its Applications - LORIA (UMR 7503), Campus Scientifique, 615 Rue du Jardin Botanique, France; email: sven.vallee@loria.fr","VoB S.Bektas T.Coniglio S.Martinez-Sykora A.","Southampton Marine and Maritime Institute","Springer Verlag","8th International Conference on Computational Logistics, ICCL 2017","18 October 2017 through 20 October 2017",,200259,03029743,9783319684956,,,"English","Lect.

The innovative part of the algorithm is the design of the optimization engine. A signal communication scheme between the trip dispatcher and the algorithm is used to improve utilization of the available idle time that can then be devoted to the optimization engine. The basic concept is as follows: a. Every trip request is treated as an emergency request demanding an immediate answer, b. The optimization engine runs continuously, thereby consuming every idle time fragment unless interrupted by a new trip request. The trip data are real, and they are sourced from a DRT system operating at a municipality in northern Greece where a static dial-a-ride algorithm was used as the optimization engine. Given the fact that these trips data provide all trip details plus the show-up time (the most important feature for our study), these data are the ideal basis for an ""a posteriori"" evaluation of the proposed online approach. Another contribution of this paper is the identification of the critical parameters in the trade-off between benefits gained from continuing to optimize an online system versus the losses of non-served demands. This important issue when applying online algorithms has not been studied extensively in the literature so far (to the best of our knowledge). © 2016 The Authors.

The goal of these problems is to compute an optimal route plan for a set of vehicles for serving transport requests of customers. There are many variants of the vehicle routing problems: routing for delivering goods, routing for demand responsive transport (taxi, school bus, ..). Each problem might have different constraints, objectives. In this paper, we introduce a Constraint-Based Local Search (CBLS) framework for general offline and online vehicle routing problems. We extend existing neighborhood structures in the literature by proposing new neighborhoods to facilitate the resolution of different class of vehicle routing problems in a unified platform. A novel feature of the framework is the available APIs for online vehicle routing problems where requests arrive online during the execution of the computed route plan. Experimental results on three vehicle routing problems (the min-max capacitated vehicle routing problem, the multi-vehicle covering tour problem, and the online people-Andparcel share-A-ride taxis problem) show the modelling flexibility, genericity, extensibility and efficiency of the proposed framework. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.","combinatorial optimization; local search; operations research; transportations; Vehicle routing","Combinatorial optimization; Local search (optimization); Operations research; Optimization; Taxicabs; Transportation; Vehicles; Capacitated vehicle routing problem; Combinatorial optimization problems; Constraint-based local searches; Demand responsive transport; Different class; Local search; Neighborhood structure; Vehicle Routing Problems; Vehicle routing",,,,,"Ralphs, T.K., Kopman, L., Pulleyblank, W.R., Trotter, L.E., On the capacitated vehicle routing problem (2003) Mathematical Programming, 94 (2), pp. 343-359. , January; Achuthan, N.R., Caccetta, L., Hill, S.P., An improved branch-And-cut algorithm for the capacitated vehicle routing problem (2003) Transportation Science, 37, pp. 153-169; Fukasawa, R., Longo, H., Lysgaard, J., De Aragão, M.P., Reis, M., Uchoa, E., Werneck, R.F., Robust branch-And-cut-And-price for the capacitated vehicle routing problem (2006) Mathematical Programming, 106 (3), pp. 491-511; Gendreau, M., Laporte, G., Potvin, J.-Y., Metaheuristics for the VRP (2002) The Vehicle Routing Problem, pp. 129-154. , P.

It studies the impact of combination restrictions, preventing particular user combinations and limiting the set of drivers to which particular users can be assigned. The academic literature currently lacks insights into the effect of these restrictions on the cost structure of a service provider. A multi-directional local search algorithm is developed to solve this problem, taking into account the fundamental tradeoff between operational efficiency and service quality. Local search is integrated into a variable neighborhood descent framework that applies an intelligent candidate list principle to reduce computation time. Moreover, a new scheduling procedure is proposed, constructing time schedules that minimize total user ride time. It proves to be faster and more efficient than existing scheduling procedures. Overall, computational experiments on existing benchmark data extended with combination restrictions reveal a general pattern in the effect of the combination restrictions. Such insights are essential for service providers in order to support policy choices, e.g. related to service quality or medical education of drivers. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Bi-objective optimization;

The problem is modeled as a multitrip pickup and delivery problem with time windows and manpower planning (MTPDPTW-MP) that not only needs to design and schedule ambulance routes satisfying a series of constraints but also requires staff scheduling. Because of the strict limits on route duration, each ambulance traverses several routes per day, which, starting and terminating at the depot, complete a series of pickup and delivery operations to serve the clients. A feasible route demands a driver and several assistants to serve the clients and needs to satisfy some constraints, such as capacity, pickup before delivery, time windows, etc. The objective is hierarchical in that it primarily serves as many clients as possible, then minimizes the operational cost, and finally strikes a balance for the staff workload. Theoretically, MTPDPTW-MP, which is a combination of two well known NP-hard problems (i.e., the pickup and delivery problem with time windows and the staff scheduling problem), is difficult to solve. In this study, we propose an iterated local search metaheuristic that uses a variable neighborhood descent procedure in the local search phase.We use a modified regret insertion method to construct solutions; a heuristic backtracking algorithm is designed to schedule staff. To speed up the process,we adapt the segment-based evaluation for moves and reduce the neighborhoods explored based on the characteristics of the problem. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was tested in real-world instances. Results showed that it can serve more requests than the manually designed plans. In addition, the performance of the proposed algorithm was evaluated on a simplified problem: the multitrip vehicle routing problem with time windows. © 2016 INFORMS.","Healthcare transportation; Iterated local search; Manpower planning; Pickup and delivery problem with time windows; Variable neighborhood descent","Ambulances; Computational complexity; Health care; Heuristic methods; Hospitals; Local search (optimization); Pickups; Planning; Scheduling; Vehicle routing; Backtracking algorithm; Iterated local search; Manpower planning; Pick-up and delivery service; Pickup and delivery problem with time windows; Transportation services; Variable neighborhood descents; Vehicle routing problem with time windows; Constraint satisfaction problems",,,,,"Alonso, F., Alvarez, M.J., Beasley, J.E., A tabu search algorithm for the periodic vehicle routing problem with multiple vehicle trips and accessibility restrictions (2007) J.

The inventory routing problem, which combines the vehicle-routing problem and the inventory control decisions, is one of the most important problems in combinatorial optimization field. To deal with the MMIRP, we develop a GRASP-based heuristic (GBH). Each GBH iteration consists of two sequential phases; the first phase is a Greedy Randomized Procedure, in which, the best tradeoff between the inventory holding cost and routing cost is looked. Then, in the second phase, as local search for the GRASP, we use the Tabu search (TS) meta-heuristic to improve the solution found in the first phase. The GBH two phases are repeated until some stopped criterion is met. Our proposed method is evaluated on two benchmark data sets, and successfully compared with two state-of-the-art algorithms. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","GRASP; Meta-heuristics; Multi product multi vehicle inventory routing; Optimization; Tabu search",,,,,,"Abdelmaguid, T.F., Heuristic approaches for the integrated inventory distribution problem.

Recently, several extensions have been proposed towards more realistic applications of the problem. In this paper, a new variant called the Multi-Depot Multi-Trip Heterogeneous Dial-a-Ride Problem (MD-MT-HDARP) is considered. A mathematical programming formulation and three metaheuristics are proposed: an improved Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS), Hybrid Bees Algorithm with Simulated Annealing (BA-SA), and Hybrid Bees Algorithm with Deterministic Annealing (BA-DA). Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for solving the underlying problem. In addition, they are competitive to the current state-of-the-art algorithm on the MD-HDARP. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Bees Algorithm (BA); Dial-a-Ride Problem (DARP); Metaheuristic; Optimization; Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)","algorithm; annealing; heterogeneity; optimization; software; transportation system; Apoidea",,,,,"Borndörfer, R., Grötschel, M., Klostermeier, F., Küttner, C., Telebus Berlin: Vehicle Scheduling in a Dial-a-Ride System (1999), pp. 391-422. , Springer Berlin Heidelberg; Braekers, K., Caris, A., Janssens, G.K., Integrated planning of loaded and empty container movements (2013) OR Spectrum, 35 (2), pp. 457-478; Braekers, K., Caris, A., Janssens, G.K., Exact and meta-heuristic approach for a general heterogeneous dial-a-ride problem with multiple depots (2014) Transport.

Typically, several users with different pickup and dropoff locations are transported on a vehicle simultaneously. The focus in dial-a-ride problems (DARPs) is mainly on minimizing routing cost. Service quality has been taken into account in the models by imposing time windows and limiting the maximum ride time of each user. We extend the classical DARP by an additional feature of service quality referred to as driver consistency. Customers of dial-a-ride services are often sensitive to changes in their daily routine. This aspect includes the person who is providing the transportation service, i.e., the driver of the vehicle. Our problem, called the driver consistent dial-a-ride problem (DC-DARP), considers driver consistency by bounding the maximum number of different drivers that transport a user over a multi-period planning horizon. We propose different formulations of the problem and examine their efficiency when applied in a Branch-and-Cut fashion. Additionally, we develop a large neighborhood search algorithm that generates near-optimal solutions in a short amount of time. Over 1000 instances are generated with close reference to real world scenarios. Extensive computational experiments are conducted in order to assess the quality of the solution approaches and to provide insights into the new problem. Results reveal that the cost of offering driver consistency varies greatly in magnitude. Depending on the instance, the cost of assigning one driver to each user can be up to 27.98% higher compared to a low-cost solution. However, routing cost increases by not more than 5.80% if users are transported by at least two drivers. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Branch-and-Cut; Dial-a-ride problem; Driver consistency; Large neighborhood search; Multiple periods","Integer programming; Optimization; Quality of service; Branch and cut; Dial-a-ride problem; Driver consistency; Large neighborhood search; Multiple periods; Costs; algorithm; disability; elderly population; neighborhood; service quality",,,,,"Amirgholy, M., Gonzales, E., Demand responsive transit systems with time-dependent demand: user equilibrium, system optimum, and management strategy (2016) Transp.

Efficient ridesharing solutions could help mitigate congestion. Some of the actions that government agencies have taken to encourage ridesharing include the availability of high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes and existing policies of discounted toll rates on HOVs. These measures encourage ridesharing by reducing costs or travel times of such trips. To study how the optimal routes change as a function of incentives for ridesharing, we modified existing pickup and delivery problems with time windows to consider changes in passenger travel time and toll cost due to vehicle load. Our computational results explore how the total route cost and time are affected by the use of HOV lanes and toll savings. In addition, our results show that it can be beneficial from a time and cost perspective to take detours to pick up additional passengers and use HOV lanes when the time saving on HOV lanes is significant. © 2016 W.

Traditional approaches rely on the full disclosure of a client's trip information to perform ride matching. However during poor service conditions of low supply or high demand, this requirement may mean that a client cannot find any ride matching their intentions. To address this within real-world road networks, we extend our map-based opportunistic client user interface concept, i.e., launch pads, from a discrete to a continuous space-time representation of vehicle accessibility to provide a client with a more realistic choice set. To examine this extension under different conditions, we conduct two computational experiments. First, we extend our previous investigation into the effects of varying vehicle flexibility and population size on launch pads and a client's probability of pick-up, describing the increased opportunity. Second, observing launch pads within a real-world road network, we analyze aspects of choice and propose necessary architecture improvements. The communication of ride share potential using launch pads provides a client with a simple yet flexible means of interfacing with on-demand transportation. © 2016 IEEE.","geographic information systems; human-computer interaction; Intelligent vehicles","Complex networks; Motor transportation; Population statistics; Roads and streets; Computational experiment; Continuous spaces; Full disclosures; Population sizes; Real world road networks; Ride matching; Service conditions; Traditional approaches; User interfaces",,,,,"Raper, J., Gartner, G., Karimi, H., Rizos, C., Applications of locationbased services: A selected review (2007) J.

This paper deals with the optimization of the patient transport operations of the Red Cross of Lower Austria, which is the main provider in this state. Different quality levels of the provided service - expressed by time windows, feasible maximum ride times and exclusive transports - are tested and analyzed on real-life instances to show daily impacts on the provider's resources. Comparisons of the developed solution approach to the recorded manual schedule prove its advantages. In contrast to previous work in this field, non-static service times that depend on the combination of patients, their transport mode, the vehicle type as well as the pickup or delivery locations are used. These service times are based on statistical analyses that have been performed on an anonymized dataset with more than 600,000 requests. Methods: To solve the given problem, a matheuristic solution approach was developed that deals with the exact optimization of combinations of requests as a first stage. Subsequently, the identified combinations are used as an input into a Tabu Search strategy, where the vehicle routing is optimized. Three representative days of the year 2012 were chosen for the four regions of Lower Austria to test five different service levels and the quality of the solution method. Results: For the standard scenario, the operation time of the manual schedule is reduced in the range from 14.1 % to 19.8 % for all tested instances. Even in the best service scenario, the matheuristic computes better results than the manual schedule. The service level has a high impact on the operation time of providers. The relative savings that are achieved by the algorithm are significantly lowered by introducing higher quality standards. The main reason is that less feasible combinations of patients can be generated. This leads to diminished opportunities for patients to be transported at the same time. The results indicate that the implementation of the developed matheuristic in daily planning decisions could decrease operation times significantly. Conclusions: Managers have to define minimum standards for the punctuality, exclusive transports and excess ride times. This is crucial in order to find a suitable compromise between the service level and an optimized resource management. © 2016 Oberscheider and Hirsch.","Ambulance service; Dial-a-ride problem; Matheuristic; Patient transport; Resource management; Service levels","ambulance; Austria; human; manager; operation duration; patient transport; red cross; resource management; statistical analysis; workload; algorithm; ambulance; emergency health service; patient transport; standards; statistics and numerical data; time to treatment; workload; Algorithms; Ambulances; Austria; Emergency Medical Services; Humans; Red Cross; Time-to-Treatment; Transportation of Patients; Workload",,,,,"Health Expenditure in Austria According to the System of Health Accounts (OECD), 1990-2012, in Million Euros, , http://www.statistik.at/web_en/statistics/health/health_expenditure/027971.html, Statistik Austria Accessed 24 Sept 2015; Sterud, T., Ekeberg, Ø., Hem, E., Health status in the ambulance services: A systematic review (2006) BMC Health Serv Res, 6, p. 82. , 16817949 1559607; Sterud, T., Hem, E., Ekeberg, Ø., Lau, B., Health problems and help-seeking in a nationwide sample of operational norwegian ambulance personnel (2008) BMC Public Health., 8, p. 3. , 18177497 2254402; Hansen, C.D., Rasmussen, K., Kyed, M., Nielsen, K.J., Andersen, J., Physical and psychosocial work environment factors and their association with health outcomes in danish ambulance personnel - A cross-sectional study (2012) BMC Public Health, 12, p. 534. , 22824415 3439275; Die Wichtigsten Zahlen 2014 [The Most Important Numbers 2014], , http://www.roteskreuz.at/organisieren/organisation/jahresbericht/die-wichtigsten-zahlen/, Austrian Red Cross Accessed 24 Sept 2015; Braekers, K., Caris, A., Janssens, G.K., Exact and meta-heuristic approach for a general heterogeneous dial-a-ride problem with multiple depots (2014) Transp Res B-Meth, 67, pp. 166-186; Borndörfer, R., Grötschel, M., Klostermeier, F., Küttner, C., Telebus Berlin: Vehicle scheduling in a dial-a-ride system (1997) Technical Report SC 97-23, Konrad-Zuse-Zentrum für Informationstechnik, , Berlin, Germany; Parragh, S., Cordeau, J.F., Doerner, K.F., Hartl, R.F., Models and algorithms for the heterogeneous dial-a-ride problem with driver-related constraints (2012) OR Spectrum, 34 (3), pp. 593-633; Paquette, J., Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., Pascoal, M.M.B., Combining multicriteria analysis and tabu search for dial-a-ride problems (2013) Transp Res B-Meth, 52, pp. 1-16; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem: Models and algorithms (2007) Ann Oper Res, 153 (1), pp. 29-46; Parragh, S., Doerner, K.F., Hartl, R.F., A survey on pickup and delivery problems.

It can be described as follows: care staff members with different qualification levels have to visit certain clients at least once per day. Assignment constraints and hard time windows at the clients have to be observed. The staff members have a maximum working time and their workday can be separated into two shifts. A mandatory break that can also be partitioned needs to be scheduled if the consecutive working time exceeds a certain threshold. The objective is to minimize the total travel- and waiting times of the care staff. Additionally, factors influencing the satisfaction of the clients or the care staff are considered. Most of the care staff members from the Austrian Red Cross (ARC) in Vienna use a combination of public transport modes (bus, tram, train, and metro) and walking. We present a novel model formulation for this problem, followed by an efficient exact solution approach to compute the time-dependent travel times out of the timetables from public transport service providers on a minute-basis. These travel time matrices are then used as input for three Tabu Search based solution methods for the scheduling problem. Extensive numerical studies with real-world data from the ARC show that the current planning can be improved significantly when these methods are applied. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Home health care; Multimodal routing; Tabu search; Time-dependent travel times","Health care; Mass transportation; Numerical methods; Optimization; Scheduling; Tabu search; Transportation; Travel time; Trolley cars; Daily scheduling; Model formulation; Multi-modal; Public transport service; Real-world optimization; Scheduling problem; Solution methods; Time dependent; Home health care",,,,,"Akjiratikarl, C., Yenradee, P., Drake, P.R., Pso-based algorithm for home care worker scheduling in the UK (2007) Comput Ind Eng, 53 (4), pp. 559-583; Begur, S.V., Miller, D.M., Weaver, J.R., An integrated spatial dss for scheduling and routing home-health-care nurses (1997) Interfaces, 27 (4), pp. 35-48; Bertels, S., Fahle, T., A hybrid setup for a hybrid scenario: combining heuristics for the home health care problem (2006) Comput Oper Res, 33 (10), pp. 2866-2890; Bräysy, O., Dullaert, W., Nakari, P., The potential of optimization in communal routing problems: case studies from Finland (2009) J Transp Geogr, 17 (6), pp. 484-490; Bredström, D., Rönnqvist, M., A branch and price algorithm for the combined vehicle routing and scheduling problem with synchronization constraints.

Dial-a-ride problem differs from other routing and scheduling problems with time windows in that it typically involves service-related constraints such as maximum ride time constraints. Most of the models for dial-a-ride problem reported in the literature assume constant travel times. Clearly, ignoring the fact that the travel time between two locations does not depend only on the distance traveled, but also on the time of the day traveled, impact the application of these models to real-world problems, in that the schedule of the route may be infeasible in the time-dependent cases. In this paper, we present a heuristic algorithm based on time-dependent travel times to assure, given a sequence of pickups and deliveries, whether a feasible schedule exists. We demonstrate that this can be done in O(n2) time. © 2016 IEEE.","Dial-a-ride Problem; First-in-first-out Property; Time-dependent Travel Time",,,,,,"Garaix, T., Artigues, C., Optimization of occupancy rate in dial-a-ride problems via linear fractional column generation (2011) Computers & Operations Research, 38, pp. 1435-1442; Parragh, S.N., Introducing heterogeneous users and vehicles into models and algorithms for the dial-a-ride problem (2011) Transportation Research Part C, 19, pp. 912-930; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem (DARP): Variants, modeling issues and algorithms (2003) 4OR, 1, pp. 89-101; Ropke, S., Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., Models and branch-andcut algorithms for pickup and delivery problems with time windows (2007) Networks, 49, pp. 258-272; Hunsaker, B., Savelsbergh, M., Efficient feasibility testing for dial-a-ride problems (2002) Operations Research Letters, 30, pp. 169-173; Kong, Y., Tang, J.F., Lau, H., Andrew, W.H., IP A note on, Efficient feasibility testing for dial-a-ride problems (2010) Operations Research Letters, 38, pp. 405-407; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B, 37, pp. 579-594; Ichoua, S., Gendreau, M., Potvin, J.Y., Vehicle dispatching with time-dependent travel times (2003) Discrete Optimization, 144, pp. 379-396; Koka, A.L., Hans, E.W., Schutten, J.M.J., Optimizing departure times in vehicle routes (2011) European Journal of Operational Research, 210, pp. 579-0587; Schilde, M., Doerner, K.F., Hartl, R.F., Integrating stochastic time-dependent travel speed in solution methods for the dynamic dial-a-ride problem (2014) European Journal of Operational Research, 238, pp. 18-30",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","28th Chinese Control and Decision Conference, CCDC 2016","28 May 2016 through 30 May 2016",,123193,,9781467397148,,,"English","Proc.

Their main feature is that their design involves an important decoupling of the search components from the problem domain ones. This allows them to extend their applicability to different problem domains without major redesign, unlike traditional methods such as metaheuristics. In this work, a hyper-heuristic is evaluated for a transportation problem. The implemented hyper-heuristic uses a greedy operator, and it implements an adapter layer that would allow it to be used in other similar problems. Experimental results shows balanced solution quality and CPU time performance, regarding other metaheuristics in literature. ï¿½ 2016 IEEE.","efficient algorithms; hyper-heuristics; Optimization; Transport","Algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Optimization; Combinatorial problem; Hyper-heuristics; Meta heuristics; Optimization techniques; Problem domain; Solution quality; Transport; Transportation problem; Problem solving",,,,,"Sï¿½rensen, K., Glover, F.W., Metaheuristics (2013) Encyclopedia of Operations Research and Management Science, pp. 960-970. , Springer; Burke, E.K., Hyde, M., Kendall, G., Ochoa, G., Ozcan, E., Woodward, J.R., A Classification of hyper-heuristics approaches (2010) Handbook of Metaheuristics, International Series in Operations Research & Management Science, 57, pp. 449-468. , (M.

Both variants are formulated as a two-stage stochastic programming model with recourse. The objective is to maximize the expected profit of serving a set of passengers and parcels using a set of homogeneous vehicles. Our solution methodology integrates an adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic and three sampling strategies for the scenario generation (fixed sample size sampling, sample average approximation, and sequential sampling procedure). A computational study is carried out to compare the proposed approaches. The results show that the convergence rate depends on the source of stochasticity in the problem: stochastic delivery locations converge faster than stochastic travel times according to the numerical test. The sample average approximation and the sequential sampling procedure show a similar performance. The performance of the fixed sample size sampling is better compared to the other two approaches. The results suggest that the stochastic information is valuable in real-life and can dramatically improve the performance of a taxi sharing system, compared to deterministic solutions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Adaptive large neighborhood search; Sampling strategies; Share-a-Ride problems; Stochastic delivery locations; Stochastic travel times","Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Location; Optimization; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Taxicabs; Travel time; Adaptive large neighborhood searches; Computational studies; Sample average approximation; Sampling strategies; Share-a-Ride problems; Stochastic information; Stochastic travel times; Two-stage stochastic programming; Stochastic models; adaptive management; numerical model; sampling; stochasticity; transportation system; travel time",,,,,"Bayraksan, G., Morton, D., A sequential sampling procedure for stochastic programming (2011) SIAM J.

This kind of transportation is quickly becoming an essential service for modern public mobility or logistics providers. In the DARP, a set of transportation requests has to be handled by a fleet of vehicles. Each request corresponds to a client to be transported from a pickup point to a delivery point. The routing costs have to be minimized, while respecting a set of constraints including time windows on nodes, maximum riding time per client and a maximal total duration of trips. An Evolutionary Local Search (ELS) based approach is proposed to solve this problem. A new greedy randomized heuristic to compute initial solutions is developed. A dynamic probabilities management mechanism is used in the local search to improve the convergence. The method is benchmarked on a classic set of instances from the literature and it is compared against state of the art methods. The numerical results show the effectiveness of this approach. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To provide the demand responsive buses generally requires planning route and schedule called diala- ride problem. However, the problem complexity increases with the increasing of the number of requests. Therefore, we propose the hierarchical and cooperative transport system. Framework of the system can reduce scale of the problem by grouping customers. We have evaluated the proposed system on a static simulation and a dynamic microscopic simulation. The simulation result has shown the system could improve service quality by reducing customer's load. Moreover, the result of the dynamic simulation have provided the detailed features of the system.

Car-pooling is the sharing of car journeys so that more than one person travels in a car. Appearing in 1940s as a result of oil shortage, car-pooling, becomes more and more popular, especially in the last decade thanks to massive use of internet. The number of web sites proposing car pooling increases constantly but they merely offer a meeting platform for different actors. The aim of this work is to propose an optimization scheme which can be deployed in such sites. Tests on instances with up to 50 requests and 15 drivers on a graph with 433 nodes show the efficiency of the methods and the necessity of such an optimization tool. © 2016","Generalized DARP; metaheuristic; ride sharing","Heuristic methods; Dial-a-ride problem; Generalized DARP; Heuristic approach; Meta-heuristic methods; Metaheuristic; Optimization scheme; Optimization tools; Ride-sharing; Optimization",,,,,"Calvo, R.W., Colorni, A., (2007) An effective and fast heuristic for the dial-a-ride problem. 4OR, 5 (1), pp. 61-73; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem: models and algorithms (2007) Annals of Operations Research, 153 (1), pp. 29-46; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 37 (6), pp. 579-594; Cordeau, J.F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problemquo (2006) Operations Research, 54 (3), pp. 573-586; D'Souza, C., Omkar, S., Senthilnath, J., Pickup and delivery problem using metaheuristics techniques (2012) Expert Systems with Applications, 39 (1), pp. 328-334; Eggers, W.D., Macmillan, P., (2013), Why governments should get behind ridesharing.

By reviewing the literature of demand services, an algorithm solving the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem with time windows and a fixed fleet of vehicles is developed and evaluated. Our contribution focuses on customers who specify their origin time from strategically chosen bus stations of the fixed infrastructure. A flexible objective function is used to reflect the customer's quality of service and also the operator's cost. Finally, simulated datasets of up to 500 user's requests are tested and compared against the public transport service of the city giving insight of how well a demand service performs. © 2016 The Authors.","Dial-a-ride problem; heuristic; routing; scheduling",,,,,,"Bodin, L., Sexton, T., The multi-vehicle subscriber dial-a-ride problem (1986) TIMS Studies in Man- Agement Science, 2, pp. 73-86; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 37, pp. 579-594; Dumas, Y., Desrosiers, J., Soumis, F., Large scale multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problems, les Cahiers du GERAD, G-89-30, École des Hautes Études Commerciales (1989) Montréal; Glover, F., Future paths for integer programming and links to artificial intelligence (1986) Computers and Operations Research, 13, pp. 533-549; Jaw, J., Odoni, A., Psaraftis, H., Wilson, N., A heuristic algorithm for the multi-vehicle advance- request dial-a-ride problem with time windows (1986) Transportation Research B, 20, pp. 243-257; Kirchler, D., Wolfler Calvo, R., A Granular Tabu Search algorithm for the Dial-a-Ride Problem (2013) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 56, pp. 120-135; Krajzewicz, D., Erdmann, J., Behrisch, M., Bieker, L., Recent Development and Applications of SUMO - Simulation of Urban Mobility (2012) International Journal on Advances in Systems and Measurements, pp. 128-138; Parragh, S.N., Doerner, K.F., Hartl, R.F., Variable neighborhood search for the dial-a-ride problem (2010) Computers & Operations Research, 37 (6), pp. 1129-1138; Parragh, S.N., Schmid, V., Hybrid column generation and large neighborhood search for the dial-a-ride problem (2012) Computers & Operations Research, 40 (1), pp. 490-497; (2012) FP7 Integrated Project, , https://www.collaborative-team.eu/, Tomorrow's Elastic Adaptive Mobility (TEAM) Nov.

These transportation times are modeled by a Gaussian distribution. We propose a framework based on an Evolutionary Local Search to find robust solutions which can withstand variations due to the stochasticity. Our method uses a law approach to solve this problem and a simulation part to support the results. The robustness of the best known solutions published for the Deterministic Dial-a-Ride Problem on instances proposed by (Cordeau and Laporte, 2003) is first analyzed. Computational results from the Evolutionary Local Search on the Stochastic Dial-a-Ride Problem are then presented. © 2016","dial-a-ride; metaheuristic; stochastic travel time; transport","Local search (optimization); Stochastic systems; Travel time; Computational results; Dial-a-Ride; Dial-a-ride problem; Metaheuristic; Stochastic transportation; Stochastic travel time; transport; Transportation time; Problem solving",,,,,"Braekers, K., Caris, A., Janssens, G.K., Exact and meta-heuristic approach for a general heterogeneous dial-a-ride problem with multiple depots (2014) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 67, pp. 166-186; Borndorfer, R., Grotschel, M., Klostermeier, F., Kuttner, C., (1997), Telebus Berlin: Vehicle scheduling in a dial-a-ride system.

Users place transportation requests with specified pickup and delivery locations and times. The requests have to be completed under user inconvenience considerations by a specified fleet of vehicles. In the dial-a-ride problem, the aim is to minimize the total travel times respecting the given time windows, the maximum user ride times, and the vehicle restrictions. This paper introduces a dynamic programming algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem and demonstrates its effective application in (hybrid) metaheuristic approaches. Compared to most of the works presented in literature, this approach does not make use of any (commercial) solver. We present an exact dynamic programming algorithm and a dynamic programming based metaheuristic, which restricts the considered solution space. Then, we propose a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm which integrates the dynamic programming based algorithms into a large neighborhood framework. The algorithms are tested on a given set of benchmark instances from the literature and compared to a state-of-the-art hybrid large neighborhood search approach. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Dial-a-ride problem; Dynamic programming; Large neighborhood search",,,,,,"Bellman, R., Dynamic programming treatment of the travelling salesman problem (1962) JACM, 9, pp. 61-63; Bent, R., Hentenryck, P.V., A two-stage hybrid algorithm for pickup and delivery vehicle routing problems with time windows (2006) Computers & Operations Research, 33 (4), pp. 875-893; Blum, C., Puchinger, J., Raidl, G.R., Roli, A., Hybrid metaheuristics in combinatorial optimization: A survey (2011) Applied Soft Computing, 11 (6), pp. 4135-4151; Bräysy, O., Gendreau, M., Vehicle routing problem with time windows, part II: Metaheuristics (2005) Transportation Science, 39 (1), pp. 119-139; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 37 (6), pp. 579-594; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem: Models and algorithms (2007) Annals of Operations Research, 153, pp. 29-46; Dumas, Y., Desrosiers, J., Gelinas, E., Solomon, M.M., An optimal algorithm for the traveling salesman problem with time windows (1995) Operations Research, 43 (2), pp. 367-371; Funke, B., Grünert, T., Irnich, S., Local search for vehicle routing and scheduling problems: Review and conceptual integration (2005) Journal of Heuristics, 11, pp. 267-306; Gendreau, M., Potvin, J.Y., Brumlaysy, O., Hasle, G., Løkketangen, A., Metaheuristics for the vehicle routing problem and its extensions: A categorized bibliography (2008) The vehicle routing problem: latest advances and new challenges, operations research/computer science interfaces series, pp. 143-169. , Golden B, Raghavan S, Wasil E, (eds), 43, Springer, New York; Gromicho, J.A.S., van Hoorn, J.J., Kok, A.L., Schutten, J.M.J., Restricted dynamic programming: A flexible framework for solving realistic VRPs (2012) Computers & OR, 39 (5), pp. 902-909; Gschwind, T., Irnich, S., Effective handling of dynamic time windows and synchronization with precedences for exact vehicle routing.

The problem is considered NP-hard, and has typically been solved using metaheuristic methods. An agent-based simulation (ABS) model was developed, where each vehicle bids to service customers based on a weighted objective function that considers the cost to service the customer and the time quality of the service that would be achieved. The approach applied a pre-processing technique to reduce the search space, given the service time window constraints. Tests of the model showed significantly better customer transit and waiting times than the benchmark datasets. The ABS was able to obtain solutions for much larger problem sizes than the benchmark solutions, with this work being the first known application of ABS to the DARP. ï¿½ 2016, South African Institute of Industrial Engineering.

As just-in-time ordering practices become more common, traditionally fixed resupply routes and schedules are increasingly unable to meet the demands of the supermarkets. Instead, we model this as a dynamic pickup and delivery problem with soft time windows (PDPSTW). We present the variable neighbourhood descent with memory (VNDM) hybrid metaheuristic (HM) and compare its performance against Q-learning (QL), binary exponential back off (BEBO) and random descent (RD) hyperheuristics on published benchmark and real-world instances of the PDPSTW.

In the dynamic variant of the problem, not all information is available in advance but is revealed during the planning process. Thus, it is crucial to anticipate future events in order to generate high-quality solutions. Previous work has shown that the use of waiting strategies has the potential to save costs and maximize service quality. We adapt various waiting heuristics to the pickup and delivery problem with time windows. Previous research has shown, that specialized waiting heuristics utilizing anticipatory knowledge potentially outperform general heuristics. Direct policy search based on evolutionary computation and a simulation model is proposed as a methodology to automatically specialize waiting strategies to different problem characteristics. Based on the strengths of the previously introduced waiting strategies, we propose a novel waiting heuristic that can utilize historical request information based on an intensity measure which does not require an additional data preprocessing step. The performance of the waiting heuristics is evaluated on a single set of benchmark instances containing various instance classes that differ in terms of spatial and temporal properties. The diverse set of benchmark instances is used to analyze the influence of spatial and temporal instance properties as well as the degree of dynamism to the potential savings that can be achieved by anticipatory waiting and the incorporation of knowledge about future requests. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Direct policy search; Dynamic pickup and delivery problem; Simulation-based optimization; Waiting strategies",,,,,,"Affenzeller, M., Winkler, S., Wagner, S., Beham, A., (2009) Genetic algorithms and genetic programming: Modern concepts and practical applications (Numerical Insights), , Chapman & Hall, UK; Attanasio, A., Cordeau, J.F., Ghiani, G., Laporte, G., Parallel tabu search heuristics for the dynamic multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2004) Parallel Computing, 30 (3), pp. 377-387; Beham, A., Kofler, M., Wagner, S., Affenzeller, M., Coupling simulation with heuristiclab to solve facility layout problems.

Users formulate requests specifying desired locations and times of pickup and delivery. Given a set of requests, the vehicle routes are to be planned and scheduled in order to minimize both the number of vehicles used and the journey durations, while respecting a set of constraints imposed by the service, the passengers and the vehicles. In a dynamic environment, requests arrive gradually along the day, and the routes must be adjusted in real time to accommodate the new demand. In this work we propose an approach that simulates a dynamic service using mixed linear programming models to produce good solutions. The obtained results for a set of instances are significative when compared to a static approach. © 2015 IEEE.","demand responsive transport; dynamic service; integer programming","Integer programming; Linear programming; Motor transportation; Transportation; Vehicles; Demand responsive transport; Dynamic approaches; Dynamic environments; Dynamic services; Mixed linear programming; Number of vehicles; Pickup and delivery; Transportation services; Fleet operations",,,,,"Crainic, T.G., Errico, F., Malucelli, F., Nonato, M., Designing the master schedule for demand-adaptive transit systems (2012) Annals of Operations Research, 194 (1), pp. 151-166; Ambrosino, G., Nelson, J., Romanazzo, M., Demand responsive transport services: Towards the flexible mobility agency (2004) ENEA, Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and the Environment; Executive, G.M.P.T., Enoch, M., Potter, S., Parkhurst, G., Smith, M., (2004) Intermode: Innovations in Demand Responsive Transport; Mageean, J., Nelson, J.D., The evaluation of demand responsive transport services in Europe (2003) Journal of Transport Geography, 11 (4), pp. 255-270; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Potvin, J.-Y., Savelsbergh, M.W., Transportation on demand (2007) Transportation, Handbooks in Operations Research and Management Science, 14, pp. 429-466; Chevrier, R., (2008) Optimisation de Transport À la Demande dans des Territoires Polarisés, , Ph.

To correct this problem, a new dynamic dial-a-ride policy is introduced, one that features non-myopic pricing based on optimal tolling of queues to fit with the multi-server queueing approximation method proposed by Hyttiä et al. (2012) for large-scale systems. By including social optimal pricing, the social welfare of the resulting system outperforms the marginal pricing assumed for previous approaches over a range of test instances. In the examples tested, improvements in social welfare of the non-myopic pricing over the myopic pricing were in the 20-31% range. For a given demand function, we can derive the optimal fleet size to maximize social welfare. Sensitivity tests to the optimal price confirm that it leads to an optimal social welfare while the marginal pricing policy does not. A comparison of single passenger taxis to shared-taxis shows that system cost may reduce at the expense of decreased social welfare, which agrees with the results of Jung et al.

In this paper, we focus on a common destination ridesharing system which is of interest in large organizations such as companies and government offices. Particularly, such organizations are looking at using company owned vehicles to offer a ridesharing service by which employees carpool to work thus leading to several benefits that include decreasing pressure on on-campus parking spaces, lowering localized on-campus congestion, in addition to offering a greener transportation mode while lowering transportation costs for employees. Based on discussions with our industry partners, optimizing the distribution of limited number of company vehicles while insuring robustness against unlikely vehicle unavailability is of critical importance. Thus in this paper, we present a stochastic mixed integer programming model to optimize the allocation of shared vehicles to employees while taking into account the unforeseen event of vehicle unavailability which would require some participants to take own vehicles or rerouting of existing vehicles. Since solving the proposed model to optimality is computationally challenging for problems of large sizes, we also propose a heuristic that is capable of finding good quality solutions in limited computational time. The proposed model and heuristic are tested on several instances of varying sizes showing the computational performance. Finally, a test case based on the city of Rome, Italy is presented and insights related to vehicle distribution and travel time savings are discussed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Car placement; Integer programming; Ridesharing","Amphibious vehicles; Optimization; Stochastic models; Traffic congestion; Transportation; Travel time; Vehicles; Car placement; Computational performance; Public transportation; Ride-sharing; Stochastic mixed integer programming; Stochastic optimization approach; Transportation cost; Travel time savings; Integer programming; car ownership; linear programing; numerical model; public transport; stochasticity; transportation planning; travel demand; travel time; Italy; Lazio; Roma [Lazio]; Rome",,,,,"Achterberg, T., Berthold, T., Improving the feasibility pump (2007) Discrete Optimization, 4 (1), pp. 77-86; Agatz, N., Erera, A., Savelsbergh, M., Wang, X., Dynamic ride-sharing: a simulation study in metro Atlanta (2011) Transportation Research Part B, 45, pp. 1450-1464; Agatz, N., Erera, A., Savelsbergh, M., Wang, X., Optimization for dynamic ride-sharing: a review (2012) European Journal of Operational Research, 223 (2), pp. 295-303; Attanasio, A., Cordeau, J.-F., Ghiani, G., Laporte, G., Parallel tabu search heuristics for the dynamic multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2004) Parallel Computing, 30 (3), pp. 377-387; Baldacci, R., Maniezzo, V., Mingozzi, A., An exact method for the car pooling problem based on Lagrangean column generation (2004) Operations Research, 52 (3), pp. 422-439; Clarke, G., Wright, J., Scheduling of vehicles from a central depot to a number of delivery points (1964) Operations Research, 12 (4), pp. 568-581; Cordeau, J.-F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54 (3), pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B, 37 (6), pp. 579-594; Desaulniers, G., Desrosiers, J., Erdmann, A., Solomon, M.M., Soumis, F., VRP with pickup and delivery (2001) The Vehicle Routing Problem, pp. 225-242. , SIAM, Philadelphia, PA, P.

LIFO loading minimizes handling while unloading items from the vehicle: the items are loaded according to a linear stack structure, and an item can only be delivered if it is the one on top of the stack. Three exact branch-price-and-cut algorithms are available for this problem. These can solve instances with up to 75 requests within one hour. We propose a population-based metaheuristic capable of handling larger instances much faster. First, a set of initial solutions is generated with a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure. For each of these solutions, local search is applied in order to first decrease the total number of vehicles and then the total traveled distance. Two different strategies are used to create offspring. The first selects vehicle routes from the solution pool. The second selects two parents to create an offspring with a crossover operator. For both strategies, local search is then performed on the child solution. Finally, the offspring is added to the population and the best survivors are kept. The population is managed so as to maintain good quality solutions with respect to total cost and population diversity. Computational results on medium to large instances confirm the effectiveness of the proposed metaheuristic. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

One of these companies may consider purchasing new trucks to reduce operation costs, when operating new trucks is cheaper than operating old ones. That is, a company can save on future operational expenditures at the cost of purchasing new trucks. Once new trucks have been bought, the fleet consists of two sub-fleets: the subfleet of new and the subfleet of old trucks. The cheaper operation [currency units/min] of new trucks makes them preferable to old trucks. Thus, old trucks start servicing orders only when all new trucks are busy. For a given time horizon, the optimal cost of the project is a trade-off between the times serviced with old trucks, new trucks, and the cost of the new trucks to be purchased. This article puts forward a method to determine the number of new trucks to purchase that maximizes the expected present value of the project that applies to full payload deliveries. It uses historical information on hour-specific expected intensities of delivery requests and delivery services. Our approach can incorporate restrictions preventing deliveries to specific customers during certain time windows. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Capacity expansion; Equipment replacement; Fleet sizing; Inventory models; Lumber shipping; Reusable items",,,,,,"Barros, O., Weintraub, A., Planning for a vertically integrated forest industry (1982) Operations Research, 30 (6), pp. 1168-1182; Buehlmann, U., Espinoza, O., Bumgardner, M., Smith, B., Trends in the US hardwood lumber distribution industry: changing products, customers, and services (2010) Forest Products Journal and Index, 60 (6), p. 547; Carlsson, D., Rönnqvist, M., Supply chain management in forestry–case studies at Södra Cell AB (2005) European Journal of Operational Research, 163 (3), pp. 589-616; Childress, S., Durango-Cohen, P., On parallel machine replacement problems with general replacement cost functions and stochastic deterioration (2005) Naval Research Logistics, 52 (5), pp. 409-419; Cordeau, J., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research, 37b6, pp. 579-594; Epstein, R., Morales, R., Seron, J., Weintraub, A., Use of OR systems in the Chilean forest industries (1999) Interfaces, 29 (1), pp. 7-29; Etezadi, T., Beasley, J.E., Vehicle fleet composition (1983) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 34 (1), pp. 87-91; Figliozzi, M.A., Boudart, J.A., Feng, W., Economic and environmental optimization of vehicle fleets.

FMOD is a demand responsive system in which a list of travel options is provided in real-time to each passenger request. The system provides passengers with flexibility to choose from a menu that is optimized in an assortment optimization framework. For operators, there is flexibility in terms of vehicle allocation to different service types: taxi, shared-taxi and mini-bus. The allocation of the available fleet to these three services is carried out dynamically so that vehicles can change roles during the day. The FMOD system is built based on a choice model and consumer surplus is taken into account in order to improve passenger satisfaction. Furthermore, profits of the operators are expected to increase since the system adapts to changing demand patterns. In this paper, we introduce the concept of FMOD and present preliminary simulation results. It is shown that the dynamic allocation of the vehicles to different services provides significant benefits over static allocation. Furthermore, it is observed that the trade-off between consumer surplus and operator's profit is critical. The optimization model is adapted in order to take into account this trade-off by controlling the level of passenger satisfaction. It is shown that with such control mechanisms FMOD provides improved results in terms of both profit and consumer surplus. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Demand responsive transit; Flexible transportation services; Mobility on demand; Personalized transportation services; Shared-ride; Shared-taxi","Economic and social effects; Fleet operations; Optimization; Profitability; Taxicabs; Vehicles; Demand responsive transit; On demands; Shared-ride; Shared-taxi; Transportation services; Transportation; mobility; optimization; public transport; real time; resource allocation; transportation system",,,,,"Ben-Akiva, M., De Palma, A., Kanaroglou, P., Dynamic model of peak period traffic congestion with elastic arrival rates (1986) Transport.

The monetary constraints provide incentives for both passengers and taxi drivers: passengers will not pay more compared with no ridesharing and get compensated if their travel time is lengthened due to ridesharing; taxi drivers will make money for all the detour distance due to ridesharing. While such a system is of significant social and environmental benefit, e.g., saving energy consumption and satisfying people's commute, real-time taxi-sharing has not been well studied yet. To this end, we devise a mobile-cloud architecture based taxi-sharing system. Taxi riders and taxi drivers use the taxi-sharing service provided by the system via a smart phone App. The Cloud first finds candidate taxis quickly for a taxi ride request using a taxi searching algorithm supported by a spatio-temporal index. A scheduling process is then performed in the cloud to select a taxi that satisfies the request with minimum increase in travel distance. We built an experimental platform using the GPS trajectories generated by over 33,000 taxis over a period of three months. A ride request generator is developed (available at http://cs.uic.edu/∼sma/ridesharing) in terms of the stochastic process modelling real ride requests learned from the data set. Tested on this platform with extensive experiments, our proposed system demonstrated its efficiency, effectiveness and scalability. For example, when the ratio of the number of ride requests to the number of taxis is 6, our proposed system serves three times as many taxi riders as that when no ridesharing is performed while saving 11 percent in total travel distance and 7 percent taxi fare per rider. © 1989-2012 IEEE.","GPS trajectory; intelliegent transportation systems; ridesharing; Spatial databases and GIS; taxi-sharing; urban computing","Behavioral research; Energy utilization; Mobile cloud computing; Random processes; Smartphones; Stochastic systems; Transportation; Travel time; Urban transportation; Gps trajectories; Ride-sharing; Spatial databases and GIS; taxi-sharing; Transportation system; Urban computing; Taxicabs",,,,,"Baldacci, R., Maniezzo, V., Mingozzi, A., An exact method for the car pooling problem based on lagrangean column generation (2004) Oper.

We model the problem as a multi-trip dial-a-ride problem (MTDARP), which requires designing several routes for each ambulance. A route is a sequence of locations, starting and terminating at the depot (hospital), according to which the ambulance picks up clients at the origins and delivers them to the destinations. A route is feasible only if it satisfies a series of side constraints, such as the pair and precedence constraints, capacity limit, ride time, route duration limit and time windows. Owing to the route duration limit, in particular, every ambulance is scheduled to operate several routes during the working period. To prevent the spread of disease, the interior of the ambulances needs to be disinfected at the depot between two consecutive trips. The primary aim of the problem investigated herein is to service more requests with the given resources, and to minimize the total travel cost for the same number of requests. In this paper, we provide a mathematical formulation for the problem and develop a memetic algorithm with a customized recombination operator. Moreover, the segment-based evaluation method is adapted to examine the moves quickly. The performance of the proposed algorithm is assessed using the real-world data from 2009 and compared with results obtained by solving the mathematical model. In addition, the proposed algorithm is adapted to solve the classic DARP instances, and found to perform well on medium-scale instances.

The system, called Mobile Resource Management System (MRMS), allows for dispatch operators to quickly study different operational scenarios and, in a strategic setting, explore tradeoffs between level-of-service and various system characteristics, including fleet composition, fleet size and dispatch rules. Such insights play a key role in making long-term investment decisions or estimating cost of servicing contracts that have service level agreements. Test comparison of manual and MRMS-based routes indicated an estimated annual operational expense reduction of 0.82 million, or about 18% of the total annual expense. In addition to the cost benefits, improved quality of service and the reduction in total vehicle-kilometers traveled leading to environmental benefits are demonstrated. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Applications; Dial-a-ride; Fleet management; Scheduling; Software","Application programs; Applications; Computer software; Fleet operations; Investments; Quality of service; Dial-a-Ride; Environmental benefits; Fleet management; Long-term investment; Routing and scheduling; Service Level Agreements; System characteristics; Vehicle routing and scheduling; Scheduling; cost-benefit analysis; investment; mobile communication; software; trade-off; transportation technology; Maryland; United States",,,,,"Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Gribkovskaia, I., Laporte, G., 'Static pickup and delivery problems: a classification scheme and survey' (2007) Top, 15 (1), pp. 1-31; Borndörfer, R., Grötschel, M., Klostermeier, F., Küttner, C., (1999) Telebus Berlin: Vehicle Scheduling in a Dial-a-ride System, , Springer; Cordeau, J.-F., 'A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem' (2006) Oper.

We study the DARP as a constraint satisfaction problem, where the goal is to find a feasible solution with respect to the time, capacity, and precedence constraints, or to prove infeasibility. The main contribution of our work is a new robust method for this problem formulation. The algorithm is based on a dynamic subroutine that finds for any set of customers a maximum cluster, that is, a maximal set of customers that can be served by a single vehicle. The performance of the algorithm is analyzed and evaluated by means of computational experiments, justifying the efficiency of the solution method. © 2015 INFORMS.","Algorithms; Dial-a-ride problem; Dynamic programming","Algorithms; Combinatorial optimization; Computational efficiency; Constraint satisfaction problems; Dynamic programming; Fleet operations; Sales; Cluster algorithms; Computational experiment; Dial-a-ride problem; Feasible solution; Fleet of vehicles; Precedence constraints; Problem formulation; Solution methods; Clustering algorithms",,,,,"Berbeglia, G., (2009) Complexity Analyses and Algorithms for Pickup and Delivery Problems, , Ph.D. thesis, HEC Montreal, Montreal; Berbeglia, G., Pesant, G., Rousseau, L.-M., Checking the feasibility of dial-A-ride instances using constraint programming (2011) Transportation Sci, 45, pp. 399-412; Bianco, L., Mingozzi, A., Ricciardelli, S., Spadoni, M., Exact and heuristic procedures for the traveling salesman problem with precedence constraints, based on dynamic programming (1994) INFOR, 32, pp. 19-31; Bodin, L.D., Sexton, T., The multi-vehicle subscriber dial-A-ride problem (1986) TIMS Stud.

The most prevalent context of dynamic time windows is when precedence is given for the two operations so that it is a priori specified that one operation must take place before the other. A prominent vehicle routing problem with dynamic time windows and precedence is the dial-a-ride problem (DARP), where user-specified transportation requests from origin to destination points must be serviced. The paper presents a new branch-and-cut-and-price solution approach for the DARP, the prototypical vehicle-routing problem with ordinary and dynamic time windows. For the first time (to our knowledge), both ordinary and dynamic time windows are handled in the column-generation subproblem. For the solution, an effective column-generation pricing procedure is derived that allows fast shortest-path computations due to new dominance rules. The new approach is compared with alternative column-generation algorithms that handle dynamic time windows either as constraints of the master program or with less effective labeling procedures. Computational experiments indicate the superiority of the new approach. © 2015 INFORMS.","Branch-and-price; Dial-a-ride problem; Dynamic time windows; Labeling algorithm; Ride-time constraints; Time synchronization; Transportation; Vehicle routing","Costs; Integer programming; Linear programming; Network routing; Routing algorithms; Transportation; Vehicles; Branch and price; Dial-a-ride problem; Dynamic time; Labeling algorithms; Time constraints; Time synchronization; Vehicle routing",,,,,"Ascheuer, N., Fischetti, M., Grötschel, M., A polyhedral study of the asymmetric traveling salesman problem with time windows (2000) Networks, 36 (2), pp. 69-79; Azi, N., Gendreau, M., Potvin, J.-Y., An exact algorithm for a vehicle routing problem with time windows and multiple use of vehicles (2010) Eur.

A possible solution to this arising problem is to compute the best routes for each new scenario. In this problem, known in the literature as the dial-a-ride problem, a number of passengers are transported between pickup and delivery locations trying to minimize the routing costs while respecting a set of prespecified constraints. This problem has been solved in the literature with several approaches from small to medium sized problems. However, few efforts have dealt with large scale problems very common in massive scenarios (big cities or highly-populated regions). In this study, a new distributed algorithm based on the partition of the requests space and the combination of the routes is presented and tested on a set of 24 different scenarios of a large-scale problem (up to 16,000 requests or 32,000 locations) in the city of San Francisco. The results show that, not only the distributed algorithm is able to solve large problem instances that the corresponding sequential algorithm is unable to solve in a reasonable time, but also to have an average improvement of 9% in the smaller problems. The results have been validated by means of statistical procedures proving that the distributed algorithm can be an effective way to solve high dimensional dial-a-ride problems. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Demand-responsive transport; Dial-a-ride problem; Distributed algorithms; Transportation; Variable neighborhood search","Algorithms; Motor transportation; Optimization; Parallel algorithms; Transportation; Demand responsive transport; Dial-a-ride problem; High-dimensional; Large-scale problem; Pickup and delivery; Sequential algorithm; Transportation services; Variable neighborhood search; Problem solving; algorithm; demand analysis; neighborhood; optimization; transportation system; urban transport",,,,,"Allahviranloo, M., Chow, J.Y.J., Recker, W.W., Selective vehicle routing problems under uncertainty without recourse (2014) Transp.

Users place transportation requests, specifying a pickup location, a delivery location, and a time window for either of the two. Based on maximum user ride time considerations, the second time window is generated. A given fleet of vehicles, each with a certain capacity, is available to serve these requests, and maximum route duration constraints have to be respected. Each request is associated with a revenue and the objective is to maximize the total profit, that is, the total revenue minus the total costs. Transportation requests involving several persons may be split if it is beneficial to do so. We formulate the DARPSRP as a mixed-integer program using position variables and in terms of a path-based formulation. For the solution of the latter, we design a branch-and-price algorithm. The largest instance solved to optimality, when applied to available instances from the literature, has 40 requests; when applied to newly generated instances, the largest instance solved to optimality consists of 24 requests. To solve larger instances a variable neighborhood search algorithm is developed. We investigate the impact of request splitting under different geographical settings, assuming favorable settings for request splitting in terms of the number of people per request. The largest benefits from request splitting are obtained for problem settings exhibiting clustered customer locations. © 2015 INFORMS.","Branch-and-price; Pickup and delivery; Split requests; Variable neighborhood search","Costs; Crashworthiness; Fleet operations; Optimization; Pickups; Profitability; Vehicle routing; Branch and price; Branch-and-price algorithms; Dial-a-ride problem; Mixed-integer programs; Pickup and delivery; Position variables; Split requests; Variable neighborhood search; Integer programming",,,,,"Almada-Lobo, B., Oliveira, J.F., Carravilla, M.A., Production planning and scheduling in the glass container industry: A VNS approach (2008) Internat.

A transportation schedule must be constructed for a set of available vehicles, and several constraints have to be considered, particularly time windows, which define an upper and lower time bound for each customer request in which a vehicle must arrive to perform the service. Because of the complexity of DARPTW, a number of algorithms have been proposed for solving the problem, mainly based on metaheuristics such as Genetic Algorithms and Simulated Annealing. In this work, a different approach for solving DARPTW is proposed, designed, and evaluated: hyperheuristics, which are alternative heuristic methods that operate at a higher abstraction level than metaheuristics, because rather than searching in the problem space directly, they search in a space of low-level heuristics to find the best strategy through which good solutions can be found. Although the proposed hyperheuristic uses simple and easy-to-implement operators, the experimental results demonstrate efficient and competitive performance on DARPTW when compared to other metaheuristics from the literature. © 2015 Enrique Urra et al.",,"Combinatorial optimization; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Optimization; Simulated annealing; Abstraction level; Combinatorial optimization problems; Competitive performance; Destination location; Dial-a-ride problem; Hyper-heuristics; Lower time bounds; Set of customers; Problem solving",,,,,"Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Thedial-a-ride problem (DARP): Variants, modeling issues and algorithms (2003) Quarterly Journal of the Belgian, French and ItalianOperations Research Societies, 1 (2), pp. 89-101; Jorgensen, R.M., Larsen, J., Bergvinsdottir, K.B., Solving the dial-a-ride problem using genetic algorithms (2007) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 58 (10), pp. 1321-1331; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Gribkovskaia, I., Laporte, G., Static pickup and delivery problems: A classification scheme and survey (2007) TOP, 15 (1), pp. 1-31; Cubillos, C., Guidi-Polanco, F., Demartini, C., (2004) Applying Genetic Algorithms to the Dial-A-Ride Problem, , http://www.worldses.org/online/, WSEAS, Turin, Italy; Cubillos, C., Urra, E., Rodríguez, N., Application of genetic algorithms for the DARPTWproblem (2009) International Journal of Computers, Communications and Control, 4 (2), pp. 127-136; Mauri, G.R., Lorena, L.A.N., Amultiobjectivemodel and simulated annealing approach for a dial-a-ride problem (2006) Workshopdos Cursos de Computacão; Zidi, I., Zidi, K., Mesghouni, K., Ghedira, K., A multiagent system based on the multi-objective simulated annealing algorithmfor the static dial a ride problem (2011) Proceedings of the 18thWorld Congress of the International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC 11), , Milan, Italy; Sörensen, K., Glover, F.W., Metaheuristics (2013) Encyclopedia of Operations Research and Management Science, pp. 960-970. , S.

This paper introduces one of the fundamental features of this type of transport: the robustness. We solve the Dial-a-Ride Problem by integrating a measure of insertion capacity called Insertability. A greedy insertion algorithm integrating this measure is developed. We also use constraint propagation to manage all the time constraints (time windows, maximum ride times and maximum route times). The algorithm is able to measure the impact of each insertion on the other non-inserted demands. We study its behaviour, discuss the transition to dynamic context, and present a way to make the system more robust. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","DARP; Dynamic; Insertability; On-demand transportation; Robustness",,,,,,"Attanasio, A., Cordeau, J.-F., Ghiani, G., Laporte, G., Parallel Tabu search heuristics for the dynamic multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2004) Parallel Comput, 30 (3), pp. 377-387; Coslovich, L., Pesenti, R., Ukovich, W., A two-phase insertion technique of unexpected customers for a dynamic dial-a-ride problem (2006) Eur.

Unlike operators in conventional public transit, ridesharing operators maintain flexible routes and schedules that are used in providing door-to-door service. These routes and schedules are typically created by using the assumption of perfect foresight about future travel times. In practice, however, vehicles may encounter traffic congestion, be delayed because of road work or an accident, or even break down. Thus, the routes and schedules may adhere to quality-of-service constraints in planning when perfect conditions are assumed, but operationally they often violate such constraints. This paper investigates the effectiveness of routes and schedules created under a deterministic travel time assumption. The paper evaluates practical solutions that force the schedules to include excess slack. Finally, the paper proposes and assesses a recourse option for use in actual operations of assigning to taxis those passengers who are likely to be picked up late. The evaluation was completed on a real-world case study in Richmond, Virginia. Copyright © 2015 National Academy of Sciences.

Such transportation problem has to respect the limits of the maximum route length, the maximum user ride time and the required time windows. It can be modeled as a static dial-a-ride problem (DARP) that is known to be NP-hard. For this problem, a hybrid algorithm combining Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Reduced Variable Neighborhood Search (RVNS) is developed to obtain its near-optimal solution, in which the RVNS is used to improve the quality of the solutions generated by the GA. Moreover, a simple constructive method is proposed to obtain high-quality initial population and a new crossover operator for the GA is adapted to the problem. Computational results on benchmark instances with up to 13 vehicles and 144 requests show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the recently proposed hybrid Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) algorithm.","Dial-a-ride problem (DARP); Genetic algorithm; Handicapped person transportation; Hybrid algorithm; Reduced Variable Neighborhood Search","Algorithms; Benchmarking; Disabled persons; Fleet operations; Optimization; Transportation; Transportation routes; Computational results; Constructive methods; Dial-a-ride problem; Hybrid algorithms; Large neighborhood search; Near-optimal solutions; Transportation problem; Variable neighborhood search; Genetic algorithms",,,,,"Borndörfer, R., Klostermeier, F., Grötschel, M., Küttner, C., (1997) Telebus Berlin: Vehicle Scheduling in a Dial-a-ride System, , Technical, Konrad-Zuse-Zentrum fur Informationstechnik, Berlin; Chevrier, R., Liefooghe, A., Jourdan, L., Dhaenens, C., Solving a dial-a-ride problem with a hybrid evolutionary multi-objective approach: Application to demand responsive transport (2012) Applied Soft Computing Journal, 12 (4), pp. 1247-1258; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-aride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 37 (6), pp. 579-594; Cordeau, J.-F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54 (3), pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem: Models and algorithms (2007) Annals of Operations Research, 153 (1), pp. 29-46; Guerriero, F., Bruni, M.E., Greco, F., A hybrid greedy randomized adaptive search heuristic to solve the dial-a-ride problem (2013) Asia-pacific Journal of Operational Research, 30 (1); Holland, J.H., (1975) Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems, , University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor, MI; Jorgensen, R.M., Larsen, J., Bergvinsdottir, K.B., Solving the dial-a-ride problem using genetic algorithms (2007) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 58 (10), pp. 1321-1331; Karabuk, S., A nested decomposition approach for solving the paratransit vehicle scheduling problem (2009) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 43 (4), pp. 448-465; Kirchler, D., Wolfler Calvo, R., A granular tabu search algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2013) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 56, pp. 120-135; Muelas, S., Latorre, A., Peña, J.-M., A variable neighborhood search algorithm for the optimization of a dial-a-ride problem in a large city (2013) Expert Systems with Applications, 40 (14), pp. 5516-5531. , a, a b; Parragh, S.N., Doerner, K.F., Hartl, R.F., Variable neighborhood search for the dial-a-ride problem (2010) Computers & Operations Research, 37, pp. 1129-1138; Parragh, S.N., Introducing heterogeneous users and vehicles into models and algorithms for the dial-a-ride problem (2011) Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 19 (5), pp. 912-930; Parragh, S.N., Schmid, V., Hybrid column generation and large neighborhood search for the dial-a-ride problem (2013) Computers and Operations Research, 40 (1), pp. 490-497; Toth, P., Vigo, D., Fast local search algorithms for the handicapped persons transportation problem (1996) Meta-heuristics: Theory and Applications, pp. 677-690. , Osman IH, Kelly JP eds, Kluwer, Boston; Toth, P., Vigo, D., Heuristic algorithms for the handicapped persons transportation problem (1997) Transportation Science, 31, pp. 60-71; Van Lon, R.R.S., Holvoet, T., Vanden Berghe, G., Wenseleers, T., Branke, J., (2012) Evolutionary Synthesis of Multi-agent Systems for Dynamic Dial-a-ride Problems GECCO'12-proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Companion, pp. 331-336; Wang, H.-F., Chen, Y.-Y., A genetic algorithm for the simultaneous delivery and pickup problems with time window (2012) Computers and Industrial Engineering, 62, pp. 84-95",,"Kacem I.","","Universite de Lorraine","45th International Conference on Computers and Industrial Engineering, CIE 2015","28 October 2015 through 30 October 2015",,118692,,,,,"English","Proc. - CIE: Int.

The dial-a-ride Problem (DARP) involves the satisfaction of a set of transport requests (which are known in advance) using a fleet of homogeneous vehicles. Each request has constraints on time windows and on maximal transport duration. In a dynamic DARP, a sub-set of the requests is not known during the phase of route planning and they arise dynamically during the routing process. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to determine the robustness of solutions favoring routing of the dynamic requests. A robust solution must be able to consider how to include the dynamic requests into planned trips. We proposed an Evolutionary Local Search (ELS) heuristic for initially solving the problem with static requests and an insertion algorithm with a simulator for handling dynamic requests. As preliminary results, the proposed approach is performed on a set of scenarios generated from real-road network based instances.","Dial-a-ride; Dynamic routing problem; ELS; Metaheuristic; Transportation","Fleet operations; Transportation; Dial-a-Ride; Dial-a-ride problem; Dynamic routing; Handling dynamics; Insertion algorithms; Metaheuristic; Real road networks; Robust solutions; Problem solving",,,,,"Fu, L., Scheduling dial-a-ride paratransit under time-varying, stochastic congestion (2002) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 36 (6), pp. 485-506; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 37 (6), pp. 579-594; Paquette, J., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Pascoal, M.M.B., Combining multicriteria analysis and tabu search for dial-a-ride problems (2013) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 52, pp. 1-16; Kirchler, D., Wolfler Calvo, R., A granular tabu Search algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2013) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 56, pp. 120-135; Parragh, S.N., Doerner, K.F., Hartl, R.F., Variable neighborhood search for the dial-a-ride problem (2010) Computers & Operations Research, 37 (6-10), pp. 1129-1138; Muelas, S., La Torre, A., Peña, J.-M., A distributed VNS algorithm for optimizing dial-a-ride problems in large-scale scenarios (2015) Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 54, pp. 110-130; Luo, Y., Schonfeld, P., A rejected-reinsertion heuristic for the static dial-a-ride problem (2007) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 41 (7), pp. 736-755; Psaraftis, H.N., A dynamic programming solution to the single vehicle many-to-many immediate request dial-a-ride problem (1980) Transportation Science, 14 (2), p. 130; Madsen, O., Ravn, H.F., Rygaard, J.M., A heuristic algorithm for a dial-a-ride problem with time windows, multiple capacities, and multiple objectives (1995) Annals of Op.

A transport service delivers staff members of different qualification levels to clients and picks them up after completion of their services. The possibility to walk to clients, interdependencies, time windows, assignment constraints as well as mandatory working time and break regulations are considered. The introduced matheuristic consists of two stages, identifying potential walking-routes and optimising the transport system. The presented numerical studies are performed with real-world based instances from the Austrian Red Cross, a major home health care provider in Austria.

In addition, travel demand is low and residents may have different destinations. Furthermore, rural communities vary widely within regions. Therefore, it is inadvisable to run a fixed schedule transit service. Government and local authorities have attempted to maintain public transit services in rural areas and improve accessibility to these services. Dial-a-Ride (DAR) systems are a form of flexible transportation for better service in rural areas by covering a relatively large area with respect to potential demand. The complexity of the problem makes the DAR problem an NP-hard problem, whose optimal solution is difficult to find in cases of medium- and large-sized problems. As a result, most paper handling solution methods for a DAR problem are based on heuristic methods. Here, we provide a solution for the DAR service problem based on a mixed-integer formulation. This study mainly discusses enhancing transit service in rural areas with complex road network topographies where fixed services are less available or are cost ineffective. In addition, we discuss improving service quality with respect to different user types. More attention is paid to considering the social side cost by minimizing not only operating costs but also the total travel times of all travelers. Computational experiments based on real-life data from a locality in Gifu Prefecture, Japan were carried out to test the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The results show decreased mean waiting time and excess ride time by considering user costs. © 2015 The Authors.","Dial-A-Ride; Rural Areas; Social Costs",,,,,,"Attanasio, A., Cordeau, J.F., Ghiani, G., Laporte, G., Parallel tabu search heuristics for the dynamic multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2004) Parallel Computing, 30 (3), pp. 377-387; (2014) Regional Standard Cost Used for Application of Subsidy for Assuring, Maintaining and Improving Regional Public Transport System, , Chubu District Transport Bureau, Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (In Japanese); Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem (DARP): Variants, modeling issues and algorithms (2003) 4OR: A Quarterly Journal of Operations Research, 1, pp. 89-101; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 37 (6), pp. 579-594; Cordeau, J.F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54 (3), pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem: Models and algorithms (2007) Annals of Operations Research, 153, pp. 29-46; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., Potvin, J.Y., Savelsbergh, M.W., (2007) Transportation on Demand.

The m-MDPDPTW is a variant of pick-up and delivery problem (PDP) and a challenging problem in the field of vehicle routing problem (VRP). The aim is to discover a set of satisfying solutions (routes) minimizing total travel distance, total tardiness time and the total number of vehicles. These routes satisfy transportation requests without contravening any of the instance specific constraints (precedence, capacity and time window constraints). In our problem each request is transported by one of the vehicles between paired pick-up and delivery locations. Such that, the depot does not retain the goods. In this paper, we assume that all vehicles have the same capacity and depart from and return to the same depot. The new encoding and structure algorithm on which this contribution is based uses a genetic algorithm, a selection process using ranking with several Pareto fronts and an elitist selection strategy for replacement. An improved encoding chromosome path representation is given to simulate the process of evolution using several types of populations in different sizes. The performance of the new algorithm is tested on data sets instances of Li & Lim’s PDPTW benchmark problems. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm gives good results. © 2015, Budapest Tech Polytechnical Institution.

The overall problem consists in first scheduling a set of jobs on a job-shop and second on delivery of completed jobs with a homogenous fleet of vehicles taking into account the loading capacity, the ready time of operation and the due dates. Job-dependant processing time, delivery time windows, and destination are addressed into a GRASP×ELS approach solving the whole problem into an integrated approach. The framework has been benchmarked on the job-shop instances and has been proved to have some merits providing high quality solution, very closed to solution provided by dedicated methods in numerous instances including the Laurence' large scale instances. A new set of instances with up to 100 operations to schedule is introduced for the problem of job-shop scheduling/routing problems and new solutions are provided.","Routing; Scheduling","Fleet operations; Optimization; Problem solving; Production control; Scheduling; Delivery time windows; Fleet of vehicles; High-quality solutions; Integrated approach; Job shop scheduling problems; Loading capacities; Production Scheduling; Routing; Job shop scheduling",,,,,"Akkerman, R., Farahan, P., Grunow, M., Quality, safety and sustainability in food distribution: A review of quantitative operations management approaches and challenges (2010) OR Spectrum, 32 (4), pp. 863-904; Bartusch, M., Mehring, R.H., Rademacher, F.J., Scheduling project networks with resource constraints and time windows (1988) Ann.

Traditional approaches also rely on the disclosure of inherently private, discrete information from both vehicle and client to perform ride matching. Catering for both aspects, we have previously suggested an intuitive interface concept, launch pads. In this paper we extend launch pads by enhancing the visualisation in a third dimension. This representation provides a client with a more detailed choice set which should lead to improved decision-making. To examine the value of this enhancement, we implement a multi-agent simulation and observe a client agent's responses to 3D launch pads visualised according to three different fare models. Results show that a client's flexibility in space is dependent on the fare model chosen, and it is this offering which can increase a client's utility. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","ad hoc ride sharing;

Given “paired” demands between customer nodes, the PMPDP is to find a set of feasible vehicle routes starting from and ending at the depot such that the constructed objective function can be optimized subject to a set of desired constraints. When the PMPDP is applied to public library delivery operations, interchangeably used with the library vehicle routing problem (LVRP) hereafter, the customer nodes are replaced by library branches and the items to be delivered and picked up become books, videos and materials. To explore the LVRP, a mathematical model is rigorously formulated and a two-stage solution algorithm involving a modified bee colony optimization method is elaborately developed. Using real data from the San Francisco library system, the computational results show that our approach performs fairly well as compared with those approaches that have appeared in the literature.

Their efficient resolution is critical in branch and bound and neighborhood search methods for vehicle routing, project and machine scheduling, as well as in various applications in network optimization, resource allocation, and statistical inference. Timing-related problems have been studied for years, yet research on this subject suffers from a lack of consensus, and most knowledge is scattered among operations research and applied mathematics domains. This article introduces a classification of timing problems and features, as well as a unifying multidisciplinary analysis of timing algorithms. In relation to frequent application cases within branching schemes or neighborhood searches, the efficient resolution of series of similar timing subproblems is also analyzed. A dedicated formalism of reoptimization ""by concatenation"" is introduced to that extent. The knowledge developed through this analysis is valuable for modeling and algorithmic design, for a wide range of combinatorial optimization problems with time characteristics, including rich vehicle routing settings and emerging nonregular scheduling applications, among others. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Branch and bound;

Sharing taxis which has been prominent in several developing countries is also becoming common in several cities around the world. Sharing taxis presents several advantages as it minimizes vacant seats in cars thus reducing costs on taxi operators which results in significantly lower taxi fares for passengers. Besides the economical advantages, taxi sharing is highly important for reducing congestion on the roads and for minimizing the impact of transportation on the environment. In this paper, we formulate the problem of assigning passengers to taxis and computing the optimal routes of taxis as a mixed integer program. To solve the proposed model, we present a Lagrangian decomposition approach which exploits the structure of the problem leading to smaller problems that are solved separately. Furthermore, we propose two heuristics that are used to obtain good quality feasible solutions. The Lagrangian approach along with the heuristics are implemented and compared to solving the full problem using CPLEX. The computational results indicate the efficiency of the methodology in providing tighter bounds than CPLEX in shorter computational time. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Integer programming; Lagrangian relaxation;

Its different basic variants have been widely explored in the literature. Even though it has been studied for years, the research around it is still very active. The new tendency is mainly focused on applying this study case to real-life problems. Due to this trend, the Rich VRP arises: combining multiple constraints for tackling realistic problems. Nowadays, some studies have considered specific combinations of real-life constraints to define the emerging Rich VRP scopes. This work surveys the state of the art in the field, summarizing problem combinations, constraints defined, and approaches found. © 2014 ACM.","Routing; Transportation; Vehicle routing problem","Amphibious vehicles; Routing algorithms; Surveys; Transportation; Vehicles; Multiple constraint; New tendencies; Optimization researches; Real-life problems; Routing; State of the art; Vehicle routing problem; Vehicle Routing Problems; Network routing",,,,,"Amorim, P., Parragh, S.N., Sperandio, F., Almada-Lobo, B., A rich vehicle routing problem dealing with perishable food: A case study (2012) TOP, 22 (2), pp. 1-20. , 2012; Baldacci, R., Bartolini, E., Mingozzi, A., Roberti, R., An exact solution framework for a broad class of vehicle routing problems (2010) Computational Management Science, 7 (3), pp. 229-268. , 2010; Baldacci, R., Bartolini, E., Mingozzi, A., Valletta, A., An exact algorithm for the period routing problem (2011) Operations Research, 59 (1), pp. 228-241. , 2011; Baldacci, R., Battarra, M., Vigo, D., Routing a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles (2008) The Vehicle Routing Problem: Latest Advances and New Challenges, 43, pp. 3-27. , B.

All of these features originate from practical applications in recent years. To formulate the problem, we propose two mathematical models that use different methods to deal with requests associated with the depot. To further strengthen the models, we propose eight families of valid inequalities, and based on them, we propose a branch-and-cut algorithm to solve the problem. The branch-and-cut algorithm was extensively tested on a set of instances generated according to the data of a real world application. The computational results showed that seven families of inequalities can improve the lower bounds substantially and the branch-and-cut algorithm can solve instances with up to 22 requests within 4 h. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Branch-and-cut;

If not accounted for, time-dependent and stochastic travel speeds frequently lead to missed time windows and thus poorer service. Especially in the case of passenger transportation, it often leads to excessive passenger ride times as well. Therefore, time-dependent and stochastic influences on travel speeds are relevant for finding feasible and reliable solutions. This study considers the effect of exploiting statistical information available about historical accidents, using stochastic solution approaches for the dynamic dial-A-ride problem (dynamic DARP). The authors propose two pairs of metaheuristic solution approaches, each consisting of a deterministic method (average time-dependent travel speeds for planning) and its corresponding stochastic version (exploiting stochastic information while planning). The results, using test instances with up to 762 requests based on a real-world road network, show that in certain conditions, exploiting stochastic information about travel speeds leads to significant improvements over deterministic approaches. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The logistics aspect of our approach is to design and execute a network system where ""premium"" goods are acquired from vendors at multiple locations in the supply network and delivered to customers. Our specific goals are to: (i) investigate the role of premium product offerings in creating critical mass and profit; (ii) develop a model for the multiple-pickup single-delivery vehicle routing problem in the presence of multiple vendors; (iii) propose a hybrid solution approach. To solve the problem introduced in this paper, we develop a hybrid metaheuristic approach that uses a Genetic Algorithm for vendor selection and allocation, and a modified savings algorithm for the capacitated VRP with multiple pickup, single delivery and time windows (CVRPMPDTW). The proposed Genetic Algorithm guides the search for optimal vendor pickup location decisions, and for each generated solution in the genetic population, a corresponding CVRPMPDTW is solved using the savings algorithm. We validate our solution approach against published VRPTW solutions and also test our algorithm with Solomon instances modified for CVRPMPDTW. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This meta-heuristic is called Golden Ball (GB), and it is based on soccer concepts. To prove the quality of our technique, we compare its results with the results obtained by two different Genetic Algorithms (GA), and two Distributed Genetic Algorithms (DGA) applied to two well-known routing problems, the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). These outcomes demonstrate that our new meta-heuristic performs better than the other techniques in comparison. We explain the reasons of this improvement. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Combinatorial optimization; Distributed genetic algorithm; Golden ball; Intelligent transportation systems; Meta-heuristics; Routing problems","Combinatorial optimization; Genetic algorithms; Gold; Heuristic algorithms; Intelligent systems; Problem solving; Sports; Traveling salesman problem; Vehicle routing; Distributed genetic algorithms; Golden ball; Intelligent transportation systems; Meta heuristics; Routing problems; Optimization",,,,,"Papadimitriou, C., The new faces of combinatorial optimization (2012) Combinatorial Optimization, pp. 19-23. , LNCS, 7422; Korte, B., Vygen, J., (2012) Combinatorial optimization: theory and algorithms, , 21, Springer, Berlin; Lawler, E., Lenstra, J., Kan, A., Shmoys, D., (1985) The traveling salesman problem: a guided tour of combinatorial optimization, , 3, Wiley, New York; Coffman, E.G., Bruno, J.L., (1976) Computer and job-shop scheduling theory, , Wiley, New York; Lenstra, J., Kan, A., Complexity of vehicle routing and scheduling problems (1981) Networks, 11 (2), pp. 221-227; Mattos Ribeiro, G., Laporte, G., An adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic for the cumulative capacitated vehicle routing problem (2012) Comput Oper Res, 39 (3), pp. 728-735; Xu, Y., Qu, R., A hybrid scatter search meta-heuristic for delay-constrained multicast routing problems (2012) Appl Intell, 36 (1), pp. 229-241; Onieva, E., Naranjo, J., Milanes, V., Alonso, J., Garcia, R., Perez, J., Automatic lateral control for unmanned vehicles via genetic algorithms (2011) Appl Soft Comput, 11 (1), pp. 1303-1309; Zheng, Y.J., Chen, S.Y., Cooperative particle swarm optimization for multiobjective transportation planning (2013) Appl Intell, 39 (1), pp. 202-216; Kang, M.H., Choi, H.R., Kim, H.S., Park, B.J., Development of a maritime transportation planning support system for car carriers based on genetic algorithm (2012) Appl Intell, 36 (3), pp. 585-604; Masoud, H., Jalili, S., Hasheminejad, S.M.H., Dynamic clustering using combinatorial particle swarm optimization (2013) Appl Intell, 38 (3), pp. 289-314; Shin, K.S., Jeong, Y.S., Jeong, M.K., A two-leveled symbiotic evolutionary algorithm for clustering problems (2012) Appl Intell, 36 (4), pp. 788-799; Harman, M., McMinn, P., de Souza, J.T., Yoo, S., Search based software engineering: techniques, taxonomy, tutorial (2012) Empirical software engineering and verification, pp. 1-59. , 7007, Springer, Berlin; Gao, J., Sun, L., Gen, M., A hybrid genetic and variable neighborhood descent algorithm for flexible job shop scheduling problems (2008) Comput Oper Res, 35 (9), pp. 2892-2907; Wang, L., Zhou, G., Xu, Y., Wang, S., Liu, M., An effective artificial bee colony algorithm for the flexible job-shop scheduling problem (2012) Int J Adv Manuf Technol, 60 (1), pp. 303-315; Zhang, R., Wu, C., Bottleneck machine identification method based on constraint transformation for job shop scheduling with genetic algorithm (2012) Inf Sci, 188 (1), pp. 236-252; Wang, K., Zheng, Y.J., A new particle swarm optimization algorithm for fuzzy optimization of armored vehicle scheme design (2012) Appl Intell, 37 (4), pp. 520-526; Rahmati, S.H.A., Zandieh, M., Yazdani, M., Developing two multi-objective evolutionary algorithms for the multi-objective flexible job shop scheduling problem (2013) Int J Adv Manuf Technol, 64 (5-8), pp. 915-932; Kirkpatrick, S., Gellat, C., Vecchi, M., Optimization by simulated annealing (1983) Science, 220 (4598), pp. 671-680; Torres-Jimenez, J., Rodriguez-Tello, E., New bounds for binary covering arrays using simulated annealing (2012) Inf Sci, 185 (1), pp. 137-152; Glover, F., Tabu search, Part I (1989) ORSA J Comput, 1 (3), pp. 190-206; Hedar, A.R., Ali, A.F., Tabu search with multi-level neighborhood structures for high dimensional problems (2012) Appl Intell, 37 (2), pp. 189-206; Goldberg, D., (1989) Genetic algorithms in search, optimization, and machine learning, , Addison-Wesley, Reading; De Jong K (1975) Analysis of the behavior of a class of genetic adaptive systems.

Hundreds of methods have been introduced in recent years for specific attributes, but the development of a single, general-purpose algorithm, which is both efficient and applicable to a wide family of variants remains a considerable challenge. Yet, such a development is critical for understanding the proper impact of attributes on resolution approaches, and to answer the needs of actual applications. This paper contributes towards addressing these challenges with a component-based design for heuristics, targeting multi-attribute vehicle routing problems, and an efficient general-purpose solver. The proposed Unified Hybrid Genetic Search metaheuristic relies on problem-independent unified local search, genetic operators, and advanced diversity management methods. Problem specifics are confined to a limited part of the method and are addressed by means of assignment, sequencing, and route-evaluation components, which are automatically selected and adapted and provide the fundamental operators to manage attribute specificities. Extensive computational experiments on 29 prominent vehicle routing variants, 42 benchmark instance sets and overall 1099 instances, demonstrate the remarkable performance of the method which matches or outperforms the current state-of-the-art problem-tailored algorithms. Thus, generality does not necessarily go against efficiency for these problem classes. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Materials and methods: The problem addressed in this work concerns the balancing inventory levels between blood transfusion centers in Morocco. This problem is characterized by a number of constraints to be taken into account: safety stock, stock ideal proportional balancing of stocks, etc. An integer linear model has been proposed to determine the optimal allocation between different centers. Two variants are examined; the first which aims to minimize the level of inventory loss, the second is to balance the different levels of stock, so that all centers have a level of surplus stock and/or loss proportional to the ideal stock.

Different strategies for transportation-demand management have been developed with the aim to decrease existing negative traffic impacts. Available strategies are based on the use of accessible transportation infrastructure and have their own characteristics. In accordance with these specific characteristics, each strategy is more or less suitable for a particular transportation network. In this paper, the writers develop a model for the best strategy selection from transportation and drivers' point-of-view. The model is based on the analytical network process, i.e., on the combination with the benefits, opportunities, costs, and risks (BOCR) merit approach, with consideration of BOCR. The approach addresses problems regarding the network structure, whereby the various criteria are relevant for the considered problem. The proposed model is applied and tested on real data collected in Belgrade, Serbia. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Analytical network process; Benefits, opportunities, costs, and risks (BOCR); Congestion; Travel-demand management strategies","Analytical network process; Benefits, opportunities, costs, and risks (BOCR); Congestion; Management strategies; Network structures; Strategy selection; Transportation infrastructures; Transportation network; Civil engineering; Transportation; analytical hierarchy process; numerical model; road transport; strategic approach; traffic congestion; traffic management; transportation development; transportation infrastructure; transportation planning; transportation system; travel demand; Belgrade; Serbia",,,,,"Azizi, M., Decision making for raw material procurement in paper making factory (2005) Proc., Int.

A parallel insertion heuristic based on the spatial and temporal aspects is presented. The proposed algorithm firstly sorts the requests based on the earliest pickup time and decentralization index alternately and initializes the routes with seed requests. Then a insertion-rejected-reinsertion operation is performed, in which the spatial aspect as the granular is also considered. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm reduces costs effectively, compared with the algorithms only considering the temporal aspect and no seed requests. Also, sensitivity analysis indicates that the required vehicle number is insensitive to the granular extent and the initial vehicle number. © 2014 IEEE.","Dial-A-Ride Problem; Parallel Insertion Algorithm; Rejected-Reinsertion; Spatio-Temporal","Control; Dial-a-ride problem; Insertion algorithms; Rejected-Reinsertion; Service Quality; Spatio-temporal; Temporal aspects; Time constraints; Vehicle numbers; Algorithms",,,,,"Garaix, T., Artigues, C., Optimization of occupancy rate in dial-A-ride problems via linear fractional column genera-tion (2011) Computers &Operations Research, 38, pp. 1435-1442; Parragh, S.N., Introducing heterogeneous users and vehicles into models and algorithms for the dial-A-ride problem (2011) Transportation Research Part C, 19, pp. 912-930; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., The dial-A-ride problem (DARP): Variants (2003) Modeling Issues and algorithms4OR, 1, pp. 89-101; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., The dial-A-ride problem: Models and algorithms (2007) Annals of Operations Research, 153 (1), pp. 29-46; Ropke, S., Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., Models and branch-andcut algorithms for pickup and delivery problems with time windows (2007) Networks, 49, pp. 258-272; Kong, Y., Tang, J.F., Pan, Z.D., Dong, G., A set partition based heuristic algorithm to solve the problem of pickup and delivery of air-passengers (2009) Journal of Northeastern University: Natural Science, 30 (5), pp. 625-627; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-A-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B, 37, pp. 579-594; Diana, M., Dessouky, M.M., A new regret insertion heuristic for solving large-scale dial-A-ride problems with time windows (2004) Transportation Research Part B, 38 (6), pp. 539-557; Luo, Y., Paul, S., A rejected-reinsertion heuristic for the static dial-A-ride problem (2007) Transportation Research Part B, 41, pp. 736-755",,,"","IEEE Computer Society","26th Chinese Control and Decision Conference, CCDC 2014","31 May 2014 through 2 June 2014","Changsha",106637,,9781479937066,,,"English","Chin.

In this work we tackle the pickup and delivery of passengers namely Demand Responsive Transport. Its idea is to group a number of passengers in the same vehicle with the respecting of the capacity of each vehicle in order to reduce operational cost with the maintaining of high quality service. This paper presents an exact Method which is the Branch and Bound Algorithm to solve a new variant of Demand Responsive Transport which is based on service quality but not as an option it is an obligation. The Multi-Vehicle Demand Responsive Transport Problem Based on Service Quality in the case of One-to-One(MVSDRTPBSQl-t-l) under study presented the following characteristics: Users specify transportation requests between origins and destinations, each customer have his own origin and own destination, they may provide a time window on their desired departure or arrival time. All demands are knows before the pacification of vehicles tours and the transportation is supplied by a fleet of vehicle based at a common depot. The aim of this paper is to find the best routing scheduled of all receipt requests with the respecting of hard Time Windows of each customer, its mean that the most important is the service quality of each customer. The novelty of our paper is presented in the new manner of algorithm application. However, we will trying to take the general architecture of Branch & Bound algorithm and using valuation rules in a different way which can adapted for such problem to find an optimal solution. © 2014 IEEE.","Branch and Bound algorithm; Demand Responsive Transport Problem; Exact Method; one-to-one transportation","Algorithms; Branch and bound method; Network routing; Quality of service; Routing algorithms; Sales; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Branch-and-bound algorithms; Demand responsive transport; Exact methods; General architectures; High quality service; Optimal solutions; Pickup and delivery; Vehicle Routing Problems; Fleet operations",,,,,"Anily, S., Gendreau, M., Laporte, G., The swapping problem on a line (1999) SIAM Journal on Computing, 29, pp. 327-335; Aldaihani, M.M., Dessouky, M.M., Hybrid scheduling methods for paratransit operations (2003) Computers and Industrial Engineering, 45 (1), pp. 75-96; Bodin, L., Sexton, T., The multi-vehicle subscriber dial-A-ride problem (1986) TIMS Studies in the Management Sciences, 22, pp. 73-86; Borndeorfer, R., Greotschel, M., Klostermeier, F., Keuttner, C., Telebus Berlin: Vehicle scheduling in a dial-A-ride system (1997) Technical Report SC, pp. 97-23. , Konrad-Zuse-Zentrum fe ur Informationstechnik Berlin; Brake, J., Nelson, J.D., Wright, S., Demand responsive transport: Towards the emergence of a new market segment (2004) Journal of Transport Geography, 12, pp. 323-337; Chalasani, P., Motwani, R., Approximated capacitated routing and delivery problems (1999) SIAMJournal on Computing, 28, pp. 2133-2149; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multivehicle dial-A ride problem (2003) Transportation Research B, 37, pp. 579-594; Cordeau, J.F., A branch-And-cut algorithm for the dial-A-ride problem (2006) Canada Research Chair in Distribution Management, , HEC Montreal 3000, chemin de la Ĉote-Sainte-Catherine Montreal, Canada H3T 2A7; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., Mercier, A., A unified tabu search heuristic for vehicle routing problems with time windows (2001) J Oper Res Soc, 52, pp. 928-936; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multivehicle dial-A-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B, 37, pp. 579-594; Diana, M., Dessouky, M.M., A new regret insertion heuristic for solving large-scale dial-A-ride problems with time windows (2004) Transportation Research Part B, 38, pp. 539-557; Dastghaibifard, G.H., Ansari, E., Sheykhalishahi, S.M., Bavandpouri, A., Ashoor, E., A parallel branch and bound algorithm for vehicle routing problem (2008) Proceedings of the International MultiConference of Engineers and Computer Scientists 2008, , II IMECS2008, 19-21 March, 2008, Hong Kong; Dumas, Y., Desrosiers, J., Soumis, F., Large scale multi-vehicle dial-A-ride problems Cahier du GERAD G (1989) EEcole des Hautes EEtudes Commerciales, Montreal, pp. 89-30; Dumas, Y., Desrosiers, J., Soumis, F., The pickup and deliveryproblem with time windows (1991) European Journal of Operational Research, 54, pp. 7-22; Jaw, J., Odoni, A.R., Psaraftis, H.N., Wilson, N.H.M., A heuristic algorithm for the multi-vehicle advancerequest dial-A-ride problem with time windows (1986) Transportation Research B, 20, pp. 243-257; Quadri, D., Soutif, E., Tolla, P., (2007) A Branch-And-bound Algorithm to Solve Large Scale Integer Quadratic Multi-knapsack Problems.

Large carriers enjoy market power from economies of scale and better networking. Small carriers rely on horizontal cooperation between each other to compete with, usually by trading on freight exchanges. One major challenge for small carriers is how to select requests so that the total profit from the delivery can be maximized. Thus in this paper we model it as a Profitable Pickup and Delivery Selection Problem, which is a generalization of the classic Pickup and Delivery Problem, but with a goal of profit maximization and it does not require all requests to be delivered. For a solution, we propose a simple graph search that traverses through feasible routes to solve the problem optimally. Preliminary computer experiments show that random Euclidean instances with up to 500 requests can be solved optimally within seconds in a single-vehicle setup, and up to 50 requests and 4 vehicles in minutes for the multi-vehicle cases, both of which are faster than the solution by the GUROBI Optimizer. For multi-vehicle cases, we also devise a greedy heuristic that is able to find a 99% optimal solution in less than a second.","Decision Support; Pickup and Delivery; Selective Pickup; Transportation; Vehicle Routing","Commerce; Decision support systems; Information systems; Optimization; Profitability; Transportation; Vehicle routing; Computer experiment; Decision supports; Euclidean instances; Horizontal cooperations; Pickup and delivery; Pickup and delivery problems; Profit maximization; Transportation markets; Problem solving",,,,,"Aráoz, J., Fernández, E., Meza, O., Solving the prize-collecting rural postman problem (2009) European Journal of Operational Research, 196 (3), pp. 886-896; Arda, Y., Crama, Y., Pironet, T., A profitable pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2008) ORBEL 22, 22nd Annual Conference of the Belgian Operations Research Society: SOGESCI-BVWB Belgian Operations Research Society; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Gribkovskaia, I., Laporte, G., Static pickup and delivery problems: A classification scheme and survey (2007) TOP, 15 (1), pp. 1-31; (2014) List of European Freight Exchanges, , http://brummifreund.de/e/freightexchanges.html, Accessed 02/10/2014; Carrabs, F., Cerulli, R., Cordeau, J.-F., An additive branch-and-bound algorithm for the pickup and delivery traveling salesman problem with LIFO or FIFO loading (2007) INFOR: Information Systems and Operational Research, 45 (4), pp. 223-238; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial - A-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 37 (6), pp. 579-594; Erdoǧan, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The attractive traveling salesman problem (2010) European Journal of Operational Research, 203 (1), pp. 59-69; (2006) Regulation (EC) on Road Driving Time and Rest Periods, , http://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/road/social_provisions/driving_time/, Accessed 03/24/2014; Annual road freight transport vehicle movements, loaded and empty, by reporting country (Mio veh-km, 1 000 jrnys) (2013) Statistics Data, European Commission, , http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=road_go_ta_vm, Accessed 02/20/2014; Gribkovskaia, I., Laporte, G., Shyshou, A., The single vehicle routing problem with deliveries and selective pickups (2008) Computers & Operations Research, 35 (9), pp. 2908-2924; Gulczynski, D., Golden, B., Wasil, E., The split delivery vehicle routing problem with minimum delivery amounts (2010) Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 46 (5), pp. 612-626; (2014) Gurobi Optimizer, , http://www.gurobi.com/, ver. 5.6.2; ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio, , http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/ibmilogcpleoptistud/; Ihde, T., (2003) Dynamic Alliance Auctions: A Mechanism for Internet-Based Transportation Markets, , Heidelberg: Physica-Verl; Physica-Verlag HD; Krajewska, M.A., Kopfer, H., Laporte, G., Ropke, S., Zaccour, G., Horizontal cooperation among freight carriers: Request allocation and profit sharing (2007) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 59 (11), pp. 1483-1491; Moura, A., Oliveira, J.F., An integrated approach to the vehicle routing and container loading problems (2009) OR Spectrum, 31 (4), pp. 775-800; Parragh, S.N., Doerner, K.F., Hartl, R.F., A survey on pickup and delivery problems: Part II: Transportation between pickup and delivery locations (2008) Journal für Betriebswirtschaft, 58 (2), pp. 81-117; Ropke, S., Cordeau, J.-F., Branch and cut and price for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2009) Transportation Science, 43 (3), pp. 267-286; Schönberger, J., Kopfer, H., (2005) Planning the Incorporation of Logistics Service Providers to Fulfill Precedence- and Time Window-Constrained Transport Requests in a Most Profitable Way, pp. 141-156. , Chapter 2.

Previous studies focused on solution algorithms for routing and scheduling challenges of a pickup and delivery problem with time windows, but the operational issues of the overall system performance under a partially dynamic environment have not been investigated. In this article, we explore the operating efficiency of a dispatching system with a degree of dynamism (i.e. a ratio of dynamic requests). It is found that a dispatching system incurs higher transportation costs and accepts fewer requests when the request arrivals are partially dynamic, as compared to static or fully dynamic scenarios. Operational policies are derived for the dispatcher to avoid the inefficient range of degree of dynamism if future demand can be anticipated. © 2012 © 2012 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies Limited.","degree of dynamism; demand responsive transport; dynamic; waiting strategies","degree of dynamism; Demand responsive transport; Dispatching systems; Dynamic environments; Operating efficiency; Pickup and delivery problem with time windows; Routing and scheduling; Waiting strategy; Dynamics; Motor transportation; Dynamic routing algorithms",,,,,"Bell, M.G.H., Wong, K.I., Nicholson, A.J., A rolling horizon approach to the optimal dispatching of taxis (2005) Transportation and traffic theory: Flow, dynamics and human interaction, pp. 629-648. , In: Mahmassani HS, editors Oxford, Oxford,: Elsevier Science Ltd; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., Dynamic pickup and delivery problems (2010) European Journal of Operational Research, 202 (1), pp. 8-15; Branke, J., Waiting' strategies for dynamic vehicle routing (2005) Transportation Science, 39 (3), pp. 298-312; Cordeau, J., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem (DARP): variants, modeling issues and algorithms (2003) A Quarterly Journal of Operations Research, 1 (2), pp. 89-101; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 37 (6), pp. 579-594; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem: models and algorithms (2007) Annals of Operations Research, 153 (1), pp. 29-46; Coslovich, L., Pesenti, R., Ukovich, W., A two-phase insertion technique of unexpected customers for a dynamic dial-a-ride problem (2006) European Journal of Operational Research, 175 (3), pp. 1605-1615; Diana, M., The importance of information flows temporal attributes for the efficient scheduling of dynamic demand responsive transport services (2006) Journal of Advanced Transportation, 40 (1), pp. 23-46; Diana, M., Dessouky, M.M., A new regret insertion heuristic for solving large-scale dial-a-ride problems with time windows (2004) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 38 (6), pp. 539-557; Fu, L., Scheduling dial-a-ride paratransit under time-varying, stochastic congestion (2002) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 36 (6), pp. 485-506; Fu, L., A simulation model for evaluating advanced dial-a-ride paratransit systems (2002) Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 36 (4), pp. 291-307; Fu, L., Teply, S., On-line and off-line routing and scheduling of dial-a-ride paratransit vehicles (1999) Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering, 14 (5), pp. 309-319; Ichoua, S., Gendreau, M., Potvin, J.Y., Exploiting knowledge about future demands for real-time vehicle dispatching (2006) Transportation Science, 40 (2), pp. 211-225; Jaw, J.-J., A heuristic algorithm for the multi-vehicle advance request dial-a-ride problem with time windows (1986) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 20 (3), pp. 243-257; Larsen, A., Madsen, O., Solomon, M., Partially dynamic vehicle routing - models and algorithms (2002) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 53 (6), pp. 637-646; Lund, K., Madsen, O., Rygaard, J.M., (1996) Vehicle routing problems with varying degrees of dynamism, , Technical report.

Determining the optimal route for a vehicle to satisfy transport requests while minimizing the total cost refers to the Single Vehicle Pickup and Delivery Problem. Beside time and distance objectives, in real world operations it is mandatory to consider further constraints such as time windows and the capacity of the vehicle. This paper presents a novel approach to solve Single Vehicle Pickup and Delivery Problems with time windows and capacity constraints by applying Nested Monte-Carlo Search (NMCS). NMCS is a randomized exploration technique which has successfully solved complex combinatorial search problems. To evaluate the approach, we apply benchmarks instances with up to 400 cities which have to be visited. The effects of varying the number of iterations and the search level are investigated. The results reveal, that the algorithm computes state-of-the-art solutions and is competitive with other approaches.","Nested Monte-Carlo search; Routing and scheduling problems; Single Vehicle Pickup and Delivery Problem (PDP); Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)","Artificial intelligence; Scheduling; Traveling salesman problem; Capacity constraints; Exploration techniques; Nested monte-carlo; Number of iterations; Pickup and delivery problems; Pickup and delivery problems with time windows; Real world operations; Routing and scheduling; Vehicle routing",,,,,"Applegate, D.L., Bixby, R.E., Chvatal, V., Cook, W.J., (2011) The Traveling Salesman Problem: A Computational Study, , Princeton University Press; Bent, R., Hentenryck, P.V., A two-stage hybrid algorithm for pickup and delivery vehicle routing problems with time windows (2006) Computers &operations Research, 33 (4), pp. 875-893; Bjarnason, R., Fern, A., Tadepalli, P., Lower bounding klondike solitaire with monte-carlo planning (2009) ICAPS; Browne, C.B., Powley, E., Whitehouse, D., Lucas, S.M., Cowling, P.I., Rohlfshagen, P., Tavener, S., Colton, S., A survey of monte carlo tree search methods (2012) Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on, 4 (1), pp. 1-43; Cazenave, T., Nested monte-carlo search (2009) IJCAI, pp. 456-461; Cazenave, T., Teytaud, F., Application of the nested rollout policy adaptation algorithm to the traveling salesman problem with time windows (2012) LION, pp. 42-54; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-A-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 37 (6), pp. 579-594; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The Dial-A-Ride Problem (DARP): Variants, modeling issues and algorithms (2003) Quarterly Journal of the Belgian, French and Italian Operations Research Societies, 1 (2), pp. 89-101; Edelkamp, S., Gath, M., Cazenave, T., Teytaud, F., Algorithm and knowledge engineering for the TSPTW problem (2013) IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI); Een, N., Mishchenko, A., Sorensson, N., Applying logic synthesis for speeding up sat (2007) Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing-SAT 2007, pp. 272-286. , Springer; Gajpal, Y., Abad, P., An ant colony system (acs) for vehicle routing problem with simultaneous delivery and pickup (2009) Computers &operations Research, 36 (12), pp. 3215-3223; Gendreau, M., Laporte, G., Vigo, D., Heuristics for the traveling salesman problem with pickup and delivery (1999) Computers &operations Research, 26 (7), pp. 699-714; Hernandez-Perez, H., Salazar-Gonzalez, J.-J., A branch-And-cut algorithm for a traveling salesman problem with pickup and delivery (2004) Discrete Applied Mathematics, 145 (1), pp. 126-139; Hosny, M.I., Mumford, C.L., Single vehicle pickup and delivery with time windows: Made to measure genetic encoding and operators (2007) Proceedings of the 2007 GECCO Conference Companion on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation, pp. 2489-2496. , ACM; Hosny, M.I., Mumford, C.L., The single vehicle pickup and delivery problem with time windows: Intelligent operators for heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms (2010) Journal of Heuristics, 16 (3), pp. 417-439; Jih, W.-R., Hsu, Y., A family competition genetic algorithm for the pickup and delivery problems with time window (2004) Bulletin of the College of Engineering, 90, pp. 121-130; Landrieu, A., Mati, Y., Binder, Z., A tabu search heuristic for the single vehicle pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2001) Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, 12 (5-6), pp. 497-508; Luby, M., Sinclair, A., Zuckerman, D., Optimal speedup of las vegas algorithms (1993) Information Processing Letters, 47 (4), pp. 173-180; Pankratz, G., A grouping genetic algorithm for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2005) OR Spectrum, 27 (1), pp. 21-41; Parragh, S.N., Doerner, K.F., Hartl, R.F., A survey on pickup and delivery problems part ii: Transportation between pickup and delivery locations (2008) Journal fur Betriebswirtschaft, 58 (2), pp. 81-117; Psaraftis, H.N., An exact algorithm for the single vehicle many-to-many dial-A-ride problem with time windows (1983) Transportation Science, 17 (3), pp. 351-357; Ropke, S., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Models and branch-And-cut algorithms for pickup and delivery problems with time windows (2007) Networks, 49 (4), pp. 258-272; Rosin, C.D., Nested rollout policy adaptation for monte carlo tree search (2011) IJCAI, pp. 649-654. , AAAI Press; Solomon, M.M., Algorithms for the vehicle routing and scheduling problems with time window constraints (1987) Operations Research, 35 (2), pp. 254-265; Srour, F.J., Van De Velde, S., Are stacker crane problems easy?

Our approach allows multiple transfers for items at arbitrary locations, and is not restricted to a set of predefined transfer points. We show that VLNS-T improves upon the best known PDP solutions for benchmark problems, and demonstrate its effectiveness on problems sampled from real world taxi data in New York City.

Most organizations in Canada and in North-America use two independent fleets to perform these missions. Although operating two separated fleets seems easier to do, it appears to be less efficient than an integrated fleet management approach able to deal with both types of demands. Taking this into consideration, this paper aims to design and evaluate the performance of three management approaches. This is a very challenging problem, since it involves solving simultaneously two difficult vehicle routing problems: an ambulance relocation problem and a dial a ride problem. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.",,"Ambulances; Health care; Hospitals; Systems engineering; Dial-a-ride problem; Emergency medical services; Fleet management; Medical facility; Relocation problem; Transfer patient; Transportation demand; Vehicle Routing Problems; Fleet operations",,,,,"Alsalloum, O.I., Rand, G.K., Extensions to emergency vehicle location model (2006) Comput.

The aim is to find a set of routes, each assigned to a vehicle, in order to satisfy the set of requests, under capacity, time windows, precedence and pairing conditions. It is usually assumed that the demand of a request, picked up at its origin, is exactly delivered at its destination (one-to-one service) and that the fleet of the vehicles is based at a single depot. From a modelling point of view, the problem could be addressed as a one-to-one capacitated Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (PDPTW) and therefore, the mathematical formulation presents, beyond the traditional capacity constraints on the vehicles, also the pairing, the precedence and the time windows conditions. In particular, the pairing conditions guarantee that each couple (pickup, delivery) has to belong to the same route while the precedence constraints impose that each pickup has to be served before the associated delivery. This paper addresses the problem with the aim of optimizing, at the same time, the maximum total ride time and the total waiting time. Then, a bi-objective PDPTW with a constraint on the maximum duration of each route is proposed and solved by a two-step approach. In particular, the first step determines a set of feasible routes by meta-heuristics. These routes are used in second step in a bi-objective set partitioning formulation solved by the epsilon-constraint method to generate efficient solutions. The parameters of the meta-heuristics are properly set by a racing procedure. Computational experiments on some benchmark instances are carried out to assess the performance of the proposed approach. © 2014 The Authors.","Epsilon-constraint Method; Multi-objective Programming; Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows; Racing Methods; Vehicle Routing",,,,,,"Birattari, M., Stützle, T., Paquete, L., Varrentrapp, K., A racing algorithm for configuring metaheuristic (2002) GECCO '02: Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference, pp. 11-18; Chevrier, R., Liefooghe, A., Jourdan, L., Dhaenens, C., Solving a dial-a-ride problem with a hybrid evolutionary multi-objective approach: Application to demand responsive transport (2012) Applied Soft Computing Journal, 12 (4); Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B, 37, pp. 579-594; Cordeau, J.F., A Branch-and-Cut Algorithm for the Dial-a-Ride Problem (2006) Operations Research, 54, pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem: Models and algorithms (2007) Annals of Operations Research, 153, pp. 29-46; Diana, M., Dessouky, M.M., A new regret insertion heuristic for solving large-scale dial-a-ride problems with time windows (2004) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 38 (6), pp. 539-557; Grandinetti, L., Guerriero, F., Pezzella, F., Pisacane, O., The Multi-objective Multi-vehicle Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (2014) Procedia- Social and Behavioral Sciences, 111, pp. 203-212; Guerriero, F., Bruni, M.E., Greco, F., A hybrid greedy randomized adaptive search heuristic to solve the dial-a-ride problem (2013) Asia-Pacific Journal of Operational Research, 30 (1); Hosny, M.I., Mumford, C.L., Single vehicle pickup and delivery with time windows: Made to measure genetic encoding and operators (2007) Proceedings of the 2007 GECCO Conference Companion on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation, pp. 2489-2496. , ACM Press New York, NY, USA; Hosny, M.I., Mumford, C.L., The single vehicle pickup and delivery problem with time windows: Intelligent operators for heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms (2010) Journal of Heuristics, 16 (3), pp. 417-439; Jorgensen, R.M., Larsen, J., Bergvinsdottir, K.B., Solving the Dial-a-Ride Problem Using Genetic Algorithms (2007) The Journal of the Operational Research Society, 58 (10), pp. 1321-1331; Kirchler, D., Wolfler Calvo, R., A Granular Tabu Search algorithm for the Dial-a-Ride Problem (2013) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 56, pp. 120-135; Liao, X.-L., Ting, C.-K., Solving the bi-objective selective pickup and delivery problem with memetic algorithm (2013) Proceedings of the 2013 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Production and Logistics, pp. 107-114; Li, H., Lim, A., A Metaheuristic for the Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (2003) International Journal on Artificial Intelligence Tools, 12 (2), pp. 173-186; Madsen, O.B.G., Ravn, H.F., Rygaard, J.M., A heuristic algorithm for a dial-a-ride problem with time windows, multiple capacities, and multiple objectives (1995) Annals of Operations Research, 60, pp. 193-208; Masson, R., Lehuédé, F., Péton, O., The dial-a-ride problem with transfers (2014) Computers and Operations Research, 41 (1), pp. 12-23; Muelas, S., Latorre, A., Peña, J.-M., A variable neighborhood search algorithm for the optimization of a dial-a-ride problem in a large city (2013) Expert Systems with Applications, 40 (14), pp. 5516-5531; Paquette, J., Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., Quality of service in dial-a-ride operations (2009) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 56 (4), pp. 1721-1734; Paquette, J., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Pascoal, M.M.B., Combining multicriteria analysis and tabu search for dial-a-ride problems (2013) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 52, pp. 1-16; Parragh, S.N., Doerner, K.F., Hartl, R.F., A survey on pickup and delivery problems I.

It consists in routing a fleet of vehicles based at a common depot in order to satisfy users' transportation requests. Each request may consist, in a number of persons, a specified pickup location, a destination location, desired departure and arrival time windows. In this paper, we investigate a new and general model for the transportation of persons. It involves three objective functions that have to be optimized in order to measure the potential efficiency of the Dial-a-Ride Problem solution on different aspects: the cost for the transportation operator, the quality of service for users and the impact on the environment. For an efficient search through the solution space, we use a multiobjective genetic algorithm, which allows us to identify a good approximation of the set of Pareto optimal solutions. Among this set of solutions, the decision-maker can select the solution with best compromise according to its preferences, without introducing a priori information about these ones. The proposed genetic algorithm is based on an optimal timing algorithm that computes pickup and delivery dates when the requests are sequenced on the vehicles. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Clustering heuristics; Dial-a-ride problem; Evolutionary algorithms; Multicriteria optimization; Optimal timing problem",,,,,,"Atahran, A., Lenté, C., T'kindt, V., Solution of a multicriteria dial-a-ride problem with an ecological measure and heterogeneous vehicles.

The suppliers of modern home appliance products in Korea not only have to provide the traditional service of simply delivering goods to customers within the promised time, but they also need to perform additional services such as installation of the product and explanation of the products functions. Therefore, businesses reducing the delivery cost while improving the quality of the service experienced by customers is an important issue. In order to meet these two demands, we generated a delivery schedule by using a heuristic clustering-based multiple ant colony system (MACS) algorithm. In addition, to improve service quality, we set up an expert system composed of a manager system and an android-based driver system. The system was tested for home appliance delivery in Korea. This paper is significant in that it constructs an expert system for the entire process of distribution, from the generation of an actual schedule to management system setup. © INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING.","Android;

In Vitória, users submit pickup and delivery requests for transportation between various origins and destinations with time windows for the pickup and delivery; these requests are serviced by a homogeneous fleet of vehicles based at the same depot. The aim is to plan a set of vehicle routes to service all requests while minimizing the transportation cost (commonly length or travel times), the number of vehicles used and the total waiting time inside the vehicles, under constraints such as vehicle capacities and precedence (the origin of a user must precede his/her destination on the route). Our CS was able to handle the particularities present in Vitória. Good computational results are reported for practical instances provided by the Department of Transportation, Traffic and Urban Infrastructure of Vitória.","Clustering search; Dial-a-ride; Multicriteria",,,,,,"Armstrong, G.R., Garfinkel, R.S., Dynamic programming solution of the single and multiple vehicle pickup and delivery problem with application to dial-a-ride, , Universidade do Tennessee, 1982.

Users may change vehicles during their trip. This change of vehicle, called a transfer, is made at specific locations called transfer points. Solving the DARPT involves modeling and algorithmic difficulties. In this paper we provide a solution method based on an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) metaheuristic and explain how to check the feasibility of a request insertion.

Experiments show that savings due to transfers can be up to 8% on real-life instances. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Dial-A-Ride; Large neighborhood search; Problem Transfers; Simple temporal problem","Adaptive large neighborhood searches; Dial-a-Ride; Dial-a-ride problem; Large neighborhood search; Problem Transfers; Simple temporal problems; Specific location; Time constraints; Computer science; Operations research; Transportation routes",,,,,"Masson R, L., A tabu search algorithm for the Dial-A-Ride Problem with Transfers (2011) Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Systems Management, pp. 1224-1232. , Metz, France; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The Dial-A-Ride Problem models and algorithms (2007) Annals of Operations Research, 153 (1), pp. 29-46; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Dynamic pickup and delivery problems (2010) European Journal of Operational Research, 202 (1), pp. 8-15; Paquette, J., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Quality of service in Dial-A-Ride operations (2008) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 56, pp. 1721-1734; Masson R, L., An adaptive large neighborhood search for the pickup and delivery problem with transfers Transportation Science, , doi:10.1287/trsc.1120.0432 articles in advance; Masson R, L., Simple temporal problems in route scheduling for the Dial-A-Ride Problem with Transfers (2012) Integration of AI and or Techniques in Constraint Programming for Combinatorial Optimization Problems - 9th International Conference, CPAIor 2012, pp. 275-291. , Beldiceanu N, Jussien N, Pinson E, editors Nantes, France, May 28-June 1, 2012.

In this article we assume that the customer is mainly concerned with the drop-off time because it is the most important to the customer. Based on the drop-off time specified by the customer and the customer's location, a pick-up time is calculated and given to the customer by the dispatching office. We base our formulation on a dynamic fuzzy logic approach in which a new request is assigned to a vehicle. The fuzzy logic algorithm chooses the vehicle to transport the customer by seeking to satisfy two objectives. The first reflects the customer's preference and minimizes the time a customer spends in the vehicle, and the second reflects the company's preference and minimizes the distance a vehicle needs to travel to transport the customer. The proposed heuristic algorithm is relatively simple and computationally efficient in comparison with most deterministic algorithms for solving both small and large sized problems. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Dial-a-Ride problem; Fuzzy logic; Transportation","Transportation; Dial-a-ride problem; Fuzzy logic approach; Fuzzy logic",,,,,"Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem: Models and algorithms (2007) Ann.

It is modelled as a Dial-a-ride problem (DARP), where several people share the same destination. Particular emphasis is placed on the objective function in order to consider several potentially conflicting interests. We propose a multi-criteria model from Multi-attribute Utility Theory based on the Choquet integral. The resulting multi-criteria DARP is then solved with a large neighbourhood search algorithm. This method includes classical destroy and repair heuristics as well as new operators exploiting the shared destination feature and criterion-specific operators. The algorithm is evaluated on a set of 14 real-world instances in the field of health care logistics, with up to 200 requests and 51 destination points. © 2014 Operational Research Society Ltd.","Choquet integral; dial-a-ride problem; health care logistics; large neighbourhood search; multi-criteria optimization","Integral equations; Repair; Choquet integral; Destination points; Dial-a-ride problem; Large neighbourhood searches; Multi-attribute utility theory; Multi-criteria model; Multicriteria optimization; Objective functions; Health care",,,,,"Angilella, S., Greco, S., Matarazzo, B., Non-additive robustordinal regression: A multiple criteria decision model based onthe Choquet integral (2010) European Journal of Operational Research, 201 (1), pp. 277-288; Atahran, A., Lenté, C., T'Kindt, V., Solution of amulticriteria dial-a-ride problem with an ecological measureand heterogeneous vehicles (2011) IESM 2011, InternationalConference on Industrial Engineering and Systems Management, pp. 1233-1242. , Metz, France; Banae Costa, C., De Corte, J., Vansnick, J., On themathematical foundation ofMACBETH (2005) Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis: Stateof the Art Surveys, 78, pp. 409-437. , Figueira J, Greco Sand Ehrgott M (eds) International Series inOperations Research and Management Science, Springer: NewYork; Branke, J., Deb, K., Miettinen, K., Slowinski, R., Multiobjective optimization: Interactive and evolutionary Approaches (2008) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, p. 5252. , Springer, Berlin; Branke, J., Greco, S., Slowinski, R., Zielniewicz, P., Interactive evolutionary multiobjective optimization usingrobust ordinal regression (2009) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 5467, pp. 554-568; Chevrier, R., Liefooghe, A., Jourdan, L., Dhaenens, C., Onoptimizing a demand responsive transport with evolutionarymulti- objective approach (2010) 13th International IEEE AnnualConference on Intelligent Transportation Systems, pp. 575-580. , Madeira island,Portugal, 19-22 September IEEE; Coello Coello, C., Handling preferences in evolutionarymultiobjective optimization: A survey (2000) 2000 Congress OnEvolutionary Computation, pp. 30-37; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 37 (6), pp. 579-594. , DOI 10.1016/S0191-2615(02)00045-0; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem:Models and algorithms (2007) Annals of Operations Research153, 1, pp. 29-46; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Pasin, F., Ropke, S., Schedulingtechnicians and tasks in a telecommunications company (2010) Journalof Scheduling, 13 (4), pp. 393-409; Diana, M., Dessouky, M.M., A new regret insertion heuristic for solving large-scale dial-a-ride problems with time windows (2004) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 38 (6), pp. 539-557. , DOI 10.1016/j.trb.2003.07.001, PII S0191261503000912; Dubus, J.-P., Gonzales, C., Perny, P., Choquet optimizationusing GAI networks for multiagent/multicriteria decision-making (2009) Algorithmic Decision Theory.

In real-life this operational planning problem is often complicated by several factors. Users may have special requirements (e.g. to be transported in a wheelchair) while service providers operate a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles from multiple depots in their service area. In this paper, a general dial-a-ride problem in which these three real-life aspects may simultaneously be taken into account is introduced: the Multi-Depot Heterogeneous Dial-A-Ride Problem (MD-H-DARP). Both a three- and two-index formulation are discussed. A branch-and-cut algorithm for the standard dial-a-ride problem is adapted to exactly solve small problem instances of the MD-H-DARP. To be able to solve larger problem instances, a new deterministic annealing meta-heuristic is proposed. Extensive numerical experiments are presented on different sets of benchmark instances for the homogeneous and the heterogeneous single depot dial-a-ride problem. Instances for the MD-H-DARP are introduced as well. The branch-and-cut algorithm provides considerably better results than an existing algorithm which uses a less compact formulation. All seven previously unsolved benchmark instances for the heterogeneous dial-a-ride problem could be solved to optimality within a matter of seconds. While computation times of the exact algorithm increase drastically with problem size, the proposed meta-heuristic algorithm provides near-optimal solutions within limited computation time for all instances. Several best known solutions for unsolved instances are improved and the algorithm clearly outperforms current state-of-the-art heuristics for the homogeneous and heterogeneous dial-a-ride problem, both in terms of solution quality and computation time. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Branch-and-cut algorithm; Demand responsive transportation; Deterministic annealing meta-heuristic; Dial-a-ride; Heterogeneous users and vehicles; Vehicle routing","Benchmarking; Fleet operations; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Integer programming; Optimization; Rapid thermal annealing; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Branch-and-cut algorithms; Deterministic annealing; Dial-a-Ride; Heterogeneous users; Meta heuristic algorithm; Meta-heuristic approach; Metaheuristic; Near-optimal solutions; Problem solving; algorithm; design; heuristics; numerical method; transport vehicle",,,,,"Ascheuer, N., Fischetti, M., Grotschel, M., A polyhedral study of the asymmetric traveling salesman problem with time windows (2000) Networks, 36 (2), pp. 69-79; Atahran, A., Lenté, C., T'kindt, V., (2014), doi:10.1002/mcda.1518, A multicriteria dial-a-ride problem with an ecological measure and heterogeneous vehicles.

In the literature, a large number of techniques of this kind can be found. Anyway, there are many recently proposed techniques, such as the artificial bee colony and imperialist competitive algorithm. This paper is focused on one recently published technique, the one called Golden Ball (GB). The GB is a multiple-population metaheuristic based on soccer concepts. Although it was designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems, until now, it has only been tested with two simple routing problems: the traveling salesman problem and the capacitated vehicle routing problem. In this paper, the GB is applied to four different combinatorial optimization problems. Two of them are routing problems, which are more complex than the previously used ones: the asymmetric traveling salesman problem and the vehicle routing problem with backhauls. Additionally, one constraint satisfaction problem (the n-queen problem) and one combinatorial design problem (the one-dimensional bin packing problem) have also been used. The outcomes obtained by GB are compared with the ones got by two different genetic algorithms and two distributed genetic algorithms. Additionally, two statistical tests are conducted to compare these results. © 2014 E.

Two main concepts are discussed, namely the modeling of the problem as a distributed dynamic graph, on the basis of which distributed software architecture is established, and the deployment of a multitude of autonomous entities under this architecture. The chapter considers an approach that suggests considering the individual travel preferences of the car-pool applicant as well as the car-pool drivers offering the trips, whose parameters are set in advance but still somewhat flexible.

This paper introduces one of the fundamental features of this type of transport: the robustness. This paper solves the Dial-a-Ride Problem by integrating a measure of insertion capacity called Insertability. The technique used is a greedy insertion algorithm based on time constraint propagation (time windows, maximum ride time and maximum route time). In the present work, we integrate a new way to measure the impact of each insertion on the other not inserted demands. We propose its calculation, study its behavior, discuss the transition to dynamic context and present a way to make the system more robust. © 2013 Polish Information Processing Society.",,"Dial-a-ride problem; Dynamic contexts; Fundamental features; Insertion algorithms; On demands; Operation research; Time constraints; Time windows; Computer science; Information systems",,,,,"Deleplanque, S., Quilliot, A., Constraint propagation for the dial-A-ride problem with split loads (2013) Recent Advances in Computational Optimization.

Though it focuses here on the static versions of Dial and Ride, it takes into account the fact that practical DARP has to be handled according to a dynamical point of view, and even, in some case, in real time contexts. So, the kind of algorithmic solution which is proposed here, aim at making easier to bridge both points of view.

The VRPPD problem is seen in many practical applications as logistic, distribution and transportation. However, a formal definition of the VRPPD cannot fully represent the real-life daily macro routing problem. For this reason, firstly, a new model of the very close to real-life problem is defined. Secondly, a novel heuristic algorithm with a new objective function is proposed to solve the daily macro routing problem. The proposed nature-inspired algorithm called as Heuristic Bubble Algorithm (HBA) is suitable for the proposed problem because of its particular new operators and fast response. The Matlab simulation results motivate that the proposed model and HBA is capable of solving real-life macro routing problems. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Formal definition; Matlab simulations; Nature-inspired algorithms; Objective functions; Pickup and delivery; Real-life problems; Routing problems; Vehicle Routing Problems; Artificial intelligence; Heuristic algorithms; Information science; MATLAB; Routing algorithms; Network routing",,,,,"Nanry, W.P., Barnes, J.W., Solving the pickup and delivery problem with using reactive tabu search (2000) Transportation Research Part B, 34, pp. 107-121; Bianchessi, N., Righini, G., Heuristic algorithms for the vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pick-up and delivery (2007) Computers & Operations Research, 34, pp. 578-594; Kim, B., Kim, S., Sahoo, S., Waste collection vehicle routing problem with time windows (2005) Computers & Operations Research, 33, pp. 3624-3642; Bodin, L.D., Kursh, S.J., A computer-assisted system for the routing and scheduling of street sweepers (1978) Operations Research, 26, pp. 525-537; Park, J., Kim, B., The school bus routing problem: A review (2010) European Journal of Operational Research, 202, pp. 311-319; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B, 37, pp. 579-594; Toth, P., Vigo, D., Heuristic algorithms for the handicapped persons transportation problem (1997) Transportation Science, 31, pp. 60-71; Dantzig, G.B., Ramser, J.M., The truck dispatching problem (1959) Management Science, 6, pp. 80-91; Clarke, G., Wright, J.W., Scheduling of vehicles from a central depot to a number of delivery points (1964) Operations Research, 12, pp. 568-581; Laporte, G., The vehicle routing problem: An overview of exact and approximate algorithms (1992) European Journal of Operational Research, 59, pp. 345-358; Toth, P., Vigo, D., The vehicle routing problem (2002) SIAM Monographs on Discrete Mathematics and Applications, 9; Christofides, N., Mignozzi, A., Toth, P., Exact algorithms for the vehicle routing problem based on spanning tree and shortest path relaxations (1981) Mathematical Programming, 20, pp. 255-282; Toth, P., Vigo, D., Exact solution of the vehicle routing problem (1998) Fleet Management and Logistics, pp. 1-31; Osman, I.H., Metastrategy simulated annealing and tabu search algoritms for vehicle routing problem (1993) Annals of Operations Research, 41, pp. 421-451; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., Mercier, A., A unified tabu search heuristic for vehicle routing problems with time windows (2001) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 52, pp. 928-936; Baker, B.M., Ayechew, M.A., A genetic algorithm for the vehicle routing problem (2003) Computes & Operations Research, 30, pp. 787-800; Bell, J.E., McMullen, P.R., Ant colony optimization techniques for the vehicle routing problem (2004) Advanced Engineering Informatics, 18, pp. 41-48; Tan, K.C., Chew, Y.H., Lee, L.H., A hybrid multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for solving truck and trailer vehicle routing problem (2006) European Journal of Operational Research, 172, pp. 855-885; Min, H., The multiple vehicle routing problem with simultaneous delivery and pick-up points (1989) Transportation Research Part A: General, 23, pp. 377-386; Li, H., A metaheuristic for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2003) International Journal on Artificial Intelligence Tools, 12; Li, F., Golden, B., Wasil, E., The open vehicle routing problem: Algorithms, large-scale test problems and computational results (2007) Computers & Operations Research, 34, pp. 2918-2930; Dumas, Y., Desrosiers, J., Soumis, F., The pickup and delivery problem with time windows (1991) European Journal of Operational Research, 54, pp. 7-22; Banos, R., Ortega, J., Gil, C., Marquez, A.L., Toro, F., A hybrid meta-heuristic for multi-objective vehicle routing problem with time windows Computers & Industrial Engineering, 65, pp. 286-296; Jozefowiez, N., Semet, F., Talbi, E., Multi-objective vehicle routing problems (2008) European Journal of Operational Research, 189, pp. 293-309; Kritikos, M.N., Ioannou, G., The balanced cargo vehicle routing problem with time windows (2010) International Journal of Production Economics, 123, pp. 42-51","Istanbul Technical University, Control and Automation Engineering Department, Maslak, TR-34469, Istanbul, Turkey",,,,"14th IEEE International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Informatics, CINTI 2013","19 November 2013 through 21 November 2013","Budapest",102514,,9781479901975,,,"English","CINTI - IEEE Int.

This article first reviews the main classes of attributes, providing a survey of heuristics and meta-heuristics for Multi-Attribute Vehicle Routing Problems (MAVRP). It then takes a closer look at the concepts of 64 remarkable meta-heuristics, selected objectively for their outstanding performance on 15 classic MAVRP with different attributes. This cross-analysis leads to the identification of ""winning strategies"" in designing effective heuristics for MAVRP.

It concerns the delivery of drugs and medical devices from the home care company's pharmacy to patients' homes, delivery of special drugs from a hospital to patients, pickup of bio samples and unused drugs and medical devices from patients. The problem can be considered as a special vehicle routing problem with simultaneous delivery and pickup and time windows, with four types of demands: delivery from depot to patient, delivery from a hospital to patient, pickup from a patient to depot and pickup from a patient to a medical lab. Each patient is visited by one vehicle and each vehicle visits each node at most once. Patients are associated with time windows and vehicles with capacity. Two mixed-integer programming models are proposed. We then propose a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and a Tabu Search (TS) method. The GA is based on a permutation chromosome, a split procedure and local search. The TS is based on route assignment attributes of patients, an augmented cost function, route re-optimization, and attribute-based aspiration levels. These approaches are tested on test instances derived from existing VRPTW benchmarks. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This type of routing problem arises when a priority is given to customer needs or dispatching vital goods supply after a natural disaster. This paper focuses on comparing the performances of neighbourhood and population-based approaches for the new problem CCVRP. Genetic algorithm (GA), an evolutionary algorithm using particle swarm optimization mechanism with GA operators, and tabu search (TS) are compared in terms of required CPU time and obtained objective values. In addition, a nearest neighbourhood-based initial solution technique is also proposed within the paper. To the best of authors' knowledge, this paper constitutes a base for comparisons along with GA, and TS for further possible publications on the new problem CCVRP. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","cumulative capacitated vehicle routing problem; genetic algorithm; particle swarm optimization; tabu search algorithm",,,,,,"Clark, G., Wright, J.W., Scheduling of vehicles from a central depot to a number of delivery points (1964) Oper.

Today, this type of shared transport is used for elderly and disabled people for short distances. People provide a request for transport from an origin to a destination, both specific for a particular demand. Time constraints deal with maximum user ride time, time windows, maximum route duration limits and precedence.

The optimization of ground handling fleet management is considered with the aim of minimizing aircraft delays at departure in addition to the operational cost of the ground service fleets. The complexity of the resulting optimization problem and operational considerations lead to propose a decentralized management structure to solve the nominal as well as the real time fleet management problem. Then, after proposing a collaborative scheme between ground handling fleet managers, airlines and airport authorities, an heuristic approach is proposed to solve each fleet management problem.

Despite the great potential, taxi ridesharing, especially with dynamic queries, is not well studied. In this paper, we formally define the dynamic ridesharing problem and propose a large-scale taxi ridesharing service. It efficiently serves real-time requests sent by taxi users and generates ridesharing schedules that reduce the total travel distance significantly. In our method, we first propose a taxi searching algorithm using a spatio-temporal index to quickly retrieve candidate taxis that are likely to satisfy a user query. A scheduling algorithm is then proposed. It checks each candidate taxi and inserts the query's trip into the schedule of the taxi which satisfies the query with minimum additional incurred travel distance. To tackle the heavy computational load, a lazy shortest path calculation strategy is devised to speed up the scheduling algorithm. We evaluated our service using a GPS trajectory dataset generated by over 33,000 taxis during a period of 3 months. By learning the spatio-temporal distributions of real user queries from this dataset, we built an experimental platform that simulates user real behaviours in taking a taxi. Tested on this platform with extensive experiments, our approach demonstrated its efficiency, effectiveness, and scalability. For example, our proposed service serves 25% additional taxi users while saving 13% travel distance compared with no-ridesharing (when the ratio of the number of queries to that of taxis is 6). © 2013 IEEE.",,"Computational loads; Experimental platform; Gps trajectories; Its efficiencies; Large-scale dynamics; Searching algorithms; Social and environmental; Spatiotemporal distributions; Behavioral research; Energy utilization; Taxicabs",,,,,"Attanasio, A., Cordeau, J.F., Ghiani, G., Laporte, G., Parallel tabu search heuristics for the dynamic multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2004) Parallel Computing, 30, pp. 377-387. , March; Baldacci, R., Maniezzo, V., Mingozzi, A., An exact method for the car pooling problem based on Lagrangean column generation (2004) Operations Research, 52 (3), pp. 422-439. , DOI 10.1287/opre.1030.0106; Beaudry, A., Laporte, G., Melo, T., Nickel, S., Dynamic transportation of patients in hospitals (2010) OR Spectrum; Rimantas Benetis, Jensen, S., Karciauskas, G., Saltenis, S., Nearest and reverse nearest neighbor queries for moving objects (2006) The VLDB Journal, 15 (3), pp. 229-249; Calvo, R.W., Colorni, A., An effective and fast heuristic for the dial-a-ride problem (2007) 4OR: A Quarterly Journal of Operations Research, 5, pp. 61-73; Calvo, R.W., De Luigi, F., Haastrup, P., Maniezzo, V., A distributed geographic information system for the daily carpooling problem (2004) Computer Operation Research, , Elsevier Science Ltd; Colorni, A., Righini, G., Modeling and optimizing dynamic dial-a-ride problems (2001) International transactions in operational research, 8 (2), pp. 155-166; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 37, pp. 579-594. , July; Cordeau, J.F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operation Research, 54, pp. 573-586; Delling, D., Goldberg, A.V., Werneck, R.F., Faster Batched Shortest Paths in Road Networks (2011) ATMOS, 20, pp. 52-63. , Germany; Desrochers, M., Lenstra, J., Savelsbergh, M., Soumis, F., Vehicle routing with time windows: Optimization and approximation (1988) Vehicle Routing: Methods and Studies, pp. 65-84. , Amsterdam; D'Orey, P., Fernandes, R., M.

Here, we present a real life ship routing and scheduling problem for a shipping company operating in project shipping, a special segment of tramp shipping. This segment differs from more traditional tramp segments, as the cargoes are usually transported on a one-time basis. Because of the special nature of the cargoes, complicating requirements regarding stowage onboard the ships and cargo coupling must be considered while determining routes and schedules for the ships in the fleet. A mathematical model is presented and a tabu search heuristic is proposed to solve the problem. Computational results show that the tabu search heuristic provides optimal or near-optimal solutions in a reasonable amount of time, and that it can give significant improvements to manual planning for the shipping company. © 2011 The Author(s).","Cargo coupling; Maritime transportation; Stowage; Tabu search",,,,,,"Avriel, M., Penn, M., Shpirer, N., Witteboon, S., Stowage planning for container ships to reduce the number of shifts (1998) Annals of Operation Research, 76, pp. 55-71; Bausch, D.O., Brown, G.G., Ronen, D., Scheduling short-term marine transport of bulk products (1998) Maritime Policy and Management, 25, pp. 335-348; Brønmo, G., Christiansen, M., Fagerholt, K., Nygreen, B., A multi-start local search heuristic for ship scheduling-A computational study (2007) Computers & Operations Research, 34, pp. 900-917; Brønmo, G., Christiansen, M., Fagerholt, K., Nygreen, B., Ship routing and scheduling with flexible cargo sizes (2006) Journal of the Operation Research Society, 58, pp. 1167-1177; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research.

Large cities are demanding more and more share transportation services with flexible routes, resulting from user dynamic demands. In this study a new algorithm is proposed for solving the problem of computing the best routes that a public transportation company could offer to satisfy a number of customer requests. In this problem, known in the literature as the dial-a-ride problem, a number of passengers has to be transported between pickup and delivery locations trying to minimize the routing costs while respecting a set of pre-specified constraints (maximum pickup time, maximum ride duration and maximum load per vehicle). For optimizing this problem, a new variable neighborhood search has been developed and tested on a set of 24 different scenarios of a large-scale dial-a-ride problem in the city of San Francisco. The results have been compared against two state-of-the-art algorithms of the literature and validated by means of statistical procedures proving that the new algorithm has obtained the best overall results. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A vehicle can perform multiple routes per day, all starting and ending at a single depot, and it is assigned to a single driver whose total work hours are limited. A column generation algorithm is proposed. The column generation pricing subproblem requires a specific elementary shortest path problem with resource constraints algorithm to address the possibility for each vehicle performing multiple routes per day and to address the need to set the workday's start time within the planning horizon. A constructive heuristic and a metaheuristic based on tabu search are also developed to find good solutions. © 2013 Michel Povlovitsch Seixas and André Bergsten Mendes.",,"Column generation; Constructive heuristic;

Each vehicle serves one customer at a time, who has a distinct origin and destination independently and uniformly distributed within the service area. The new DNN policy is a refined version of the nearest neighbor (NN) policy that is well known to perform sub-optimally when the frequency of customer requests is high. The DNN policy maintains geographically closest customer-to-vehicle assignments, due to its ability to divert/re-assign vehicles that may be already en-route to pick up other customers, when another vehicle becomes available or a new customer call arrives. Two other pertinent issues addressed include: the pro-active deployment of the vehicles by anticipating in which regions of the service area future calls are more likely to arise; and, imposition of limits to avoid prohibitively long customer wait times. The paper also presents accurate approximations for all the policies compared.

Lyngby, Denmark","The largest airports have a daily average throughput of more than 500 passengers with reduced mobility. The problem of transporting these passengers is in some cases a multi-modal transportation problem with synchronization constraints. A description of the problem together with a mathematical model is presented. The objective is to schedule as many of the passengers as possible, while ensuring a smooth transport with short waiting times. A simulated annealing based heuristic for solving the problem is presented. The algorithm makes use of an abstract representation of a candidate solution which in each step is transformed to an actual schedule by use of a greedy heuristic. Local search is performed on the abstract representation using advanced neighborhoods which modify large parts of the candidate solution. Computational results show that the algorithm is able to find good solutions within a couple of minutes, making the algorithm applicable for dynamic scheduling. Moreover high-quality solutions can be obtained by running the algorithm for 10 minutes. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Demand-responsive transportation can be used to improve transit service levels in low-demand areas. Because demand in cities can vary significantly across the region and by time of day, an effective means of determining when demand-responsive services can outperform fixed-route services, and vice versa, is needed. This research builds on existing comparison techniques that focus on gridded street systems and expands the techniques to include all types of street networks, transit schedules, and passenger demand levels.

This bus system provides a door-to-door transportation service to the handicapped. The current system is operated on a reservation basis. Instant requests of service are unable to be handled by the operation centre even space is available on the vehicles. Hence, even there is a great demand of the service, vehicle capacity is often idle. The purpose of the proposed system architecture is to improve the utilization of vehicles by accepting instant requests from users. The system contains an information system that can acquire and process both the real-time status of a bus and the relevant information of an instant request, and then response to the user promptly. A dispatching and routing module is incorporated in the system to re-plan the routes of vehicles so the newly arriving request can be satisfied efficiently. In this study, vehicle routing is modeled as a dial-a-ride transportation problem by mathematical programming techniques. Routing solutions are obtained via an algorithm that combines a heuristic method and an optimization solver.

Special needs or medically fragile students are children with special health care needs who are at increased health and safety risk. It is common practice to provide special needs students with specially-equipped buses and/or special classroom environments with specific facilities or services. However, the assignment of student services to schools is regularly made without regard to bus transportation considerations for special needs students. Considering the potentially negative impact of long school bus rides on these students, we present the first systematic, integrated analyses of special needs student busing and classroom assignments. We provide models and algorithms for maintaining administration-based transportation financial performance measures while simultaneously designing smarter transportation networks considering both student geographical location and service needs.",,,,,,,"Attanasio, A., Cordeau, J., Ghiani, G., Laporte, G., Parallel Tabu search heuristics for the dynamic multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2004) Parallel Computing, 30 (3), pp. 377-387; Braca, J., Bramel, J., Posner, B., Simchi-Levi, D., A computerized approach to the New York City school bus routing problem (1997) IIE Transactions, 29, pp. 693-702; Cordeau, J., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54 (3), pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J., Laporte, G., A Tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B, 37 (6), pp. 579-594; Ferland, J., Guénette, G., Decision support system for the school districting problem (1990) Operations Research, 38 (1), pp. 15-21; Ibeas, A., Moura, J.L., Dell'olio, L., Planning school transport: Design of routes with flexible school opening times (2009) Transportation Planning and Technology, 32 (6), pp. 527-544; Ibeas, A., Moura, J.L., Dell'olio, L., Ortuzar, J.D., Costing school transport in Spain (2006) Transportation Planning and Technology, 29 (6), pp. 483-501; Ioachim, I., Desrosiers, J., Dumas, Y., Solomon, M., Villeneuve, D., A request clustering algorithm for door-to-door handicapped transportation (1995) Transportation Science, 29 (1), pp. 63-78; Lee, S., Schniederjans, M., A multicriteria assignment problem: A goal programming approach (1983) Interfaces, 13 (4), pp. 75-81; McPherson, M., Arango, P., Fox, H., Lauver, C., McManus, M., Perrin, J., A new definition of children with special health care needs (1998) Pediatrics, 102 (1), pp. 137-139; Nagy, G., Salhi, S., Heuristic algorithms for single and multiple depot vehicle routing problems with pickups and deliveries (2005) European Journal of Operational Research, 162 (1), pp. 126-141; Pentico, D., Assignment problems: A golden anniversary survey (2007) European Journal of Operational Research, 176 (2), pp. 774-793; Russell, R., Morrel, R., Routing special-education school buses (1986) Interfaces, 16 (5), pp. 56-64; Ripplinger, D., Rural school vehicle routing problem (2005) Transportation Research Record, 1992, pp. 105-110; van der Bruggen, L., Lenstra, J., Schuur, P., Variable-depth search for the single-vehicle pickup and delivery problem with time windows (1993) Transportation Science, 27 (3), pp. 298-311","Kamali, B.; Virginia TechUnited States; email: kamali@vt.edu",,,"University of South Florida",,,,,1077291X,,,,"English","J.

The standard DARP objective is cost minimization. In addition to cost, the objectives considered in this paper include three terms related to quality of service. This gives rise to a multicriteria problem. The problem is solved by means of a flexible and simple metaheuristic which efficiently integrates the reference point method for multicriteria optimization within a tabu search mechanism. Extensive tests were performed on randomly generated data and on real-life data provided by a major transporter in the Montreal area. Results indicate that the algorithm can yield a rich set of non-dominated solutions. It can also be employed to determine good trade-offs between cost and quality of service. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Dial-a-ride problem; Multicriteria analysis; Quality of service; Reference point method; Tabu search","Costs; Economic and social effects; Multiobjective optimization; Quality of service; Tabu search; Dial-a-ride problem; Multi Criteria Analysis; Multicriteria optimization; Multicriteria problems; Nondominated solutions; Origin and destinations; Reference point method; Search mechanism; Quality control; algorithm; cost; design; multicriteria analysis; optimization; public transport; trade-off; transport vehicle",,,,,"Alves, M.J., Clímaco, J., An interactive method for 0-1 multiobjective problems using simulated annealing and tabu search (2000) Journal of Heuristics, 6 (3), pp. 385-403; Angel, E., Bampis, E., Gourvés, L., Approximating the Pareto curve with local search for the bicriteria TSP(1,2) problem (2004) Theoretical Computer Science, 310 (1), pp. 135-136; Angel, E., Bampis, E., Gourvés, L., Monnot, J., (Non)-approximability for the multi-criteria TSP(1,2) (2005) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3623, pp. 329-340. , Springer, Berlin, M.

In this kind of problems, all data are known in advance, i.e. before the optimization process has started. However, in practice, many problems are dynamic, and change while the optimization is in progress. For example, in the Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem (DVRP), which is one of the most challenging combinatorial optimization tasks, the aim consists in designing the optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles in order to serve a given set of customers. However, new customer orders arrive while the working day plan is in progress. In this case, routes must be reconfigured dynamically while executing the current simulation. The DVRP is an extension of the conventional routing problem, its main interest being the connection to many real-word applications (repair services, courier mail services, dial-a-ride services, etc.). In this chapter, the DVRP is examined, and a survey on solving methods such as population-based metaheuristics and trajectory-based metaheuristics is exposed. Dynamic performances measures of different metaheuristics are assessed using dedicated indicators for the dynamic environment. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.",,,,,,,"Alvarenga, G.B., Silva, R.M.A., Mateus, G.R., A hybrid approach for the dynamic vehicle routing problem with time windows (2005) Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems, pp. 61-67. , IEEE Computer Society, Washington, DC; Attanasio, A., Cordeau, J.F., Ghiani, G., Laporte, G., Parallel tabu search heuristics for the dynamic multi-vehicle dial-A-ride problem (2004) Parallel Computing, 30 (3), pp. 377-387; Beaudry, A., Laporte, G., Melo, T., Nickel, S., Dynamic transportation of patients in hospitals (2010) OR Spectrum 3, 1, pp. 77-107; Bent, R., Van Hentenryck, P., Dynamic vehicle routing with stochastic requests (2003) Proceedings of the 18th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pp. 1362-1363. , Gottlob, G., Walsh, T.

The purpose of these benchmarks is to compare the techniques based on the results or solutions obtained. Typically, the benchmarks include the values of optimal solutions (if they have been obtained) or values of the best known solutions. In many cases, details of how these results were obtained are not described. This may generate controversy and difficults the comparisons of techniques. This paper shows an example of ambiguity in the results of an instance of the most used VRPTW (Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows) bechmark. We show that when analyzing the optimal solution and the best approximate solution of a specific problem, the two results are equivalent. Finally, we will propose a set of guidelines to consider when publishing the results obtained by a new algorithm.","Combinatorial Optimization; Evolutionary Computing; Problem Bechmarks; Vehicle Routing Problem","Approximate solution; Evolutionary computing; Optimal solutions; Problem Bechmarks; Problem instances; Specific problems; Vehicle routing problem with time windows; Vehicle Routing Problems; Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Combinatorial optimization; Optimal systems; Routing algorithms; Network routing",,,,,"Banzhaf, W., The ""molecular"" traveling salesman (1990) Biological Cybernetics, 64, pp. 7-14; Bräysy, O., Gendreau, M., Vehicle routing problem with time windows, Part I: Route construction and local search algorithms (2005) INFORMS Transportation Science, No. 39, pp. 104-118; Chen, C.H., Ting, C.J., A hybrid ant colony system for vehicle routing problem with time windows (2005) Journal of the Eastern Asia Society for Transportation Studies, 6, pp. 2822-2836; Condeau, F., Desaulniers, G., Desrosiers, J., Solomon, M., Soumis, F., (1999) The VRP with Time Windows, , Technical Report Cahiers du GERAD G-99-13, École des Hautes Études Commerciales de Montréal; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-A-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 37, pp. 579-594; Desrochers, M., Desrosiers, J., Solomon, M.M., A new optimization algorithm for the vehicle routing problem with time windows (1992) Operations Research, 40, pp. 342-354; Joubert, J.W., (2003) An Initial Heuristic for the Vehicle Routing and Scheduling Problem, , MEng thesis, University of Pretoria, Pretoria; Julstrom, B.A., Very greedy crossover in a genetic algorithm for the tsp (1995) Proceedings of the 1995 ACM Symposium on Applied Computing, pp. 324-328; Kohl, N., Desrosiers, J., Madsen, O.B.G., Solomon, M.M., Soumis, F., 2-path cuts for the vehicle routing problem with time windows (1999) Transportation Science, 33 (1), pp. 101-116; Lau, H.C., Sim, M., Teo, K.M., Vehicle routing problem with time windows and a limited number of vehicles (2003) European Journal of Operational Research, 148, pp. 559-569; Lawler, E.L., Lenstra, J.K., Rinnooy, K., Shmoys, D.B., (1985) The Traveling Salesman Problem: A Guided Tour of Combinatorial Optimization, , Willey-Interscience Publication; Reinelt, G., TSPLIB-A traveling salesman problem library (1991) ORSA Journal on Computing, 3, pp. 376-384; Rochat, Y., Taillard, E.D., Probabilistic diversification and intensification in local search for vehicle routing (1995) Journal of Heuristics, 1, pp. 147-167; Solomon, M.M., Algorithms for the vehicle routing and scheduling problems with time windows (1987) INFORMS Operations Research, 35, pp. 254-265; Solomon, M.M., (2005) VRPTW Bechmark Problems, , http://web.cba.neu.edu/~msolomon/problems.htm","Deusto Institute of Technology, University of Deusto, Bilbao, Spain",,"Institute for Systems and Technologies of Information,;Control and Communication (INSTICC)",,"4th International Joint Conference on Computational Intelligence, IJCCI 2012","5 October 2012 through 7 October 2012","Barcelona",100167,,9789898565334,,,"English","IJCCI - Proc.

Though it focuses here on the static version of Dial and Ride, it takes into account the fact that practical DARP has to be handled according to a dynamical point of view, and even, in some case, in real time contexts. So, the kind of algorithmic solution which is proposed here, aim at making easier to bridge both points of view. The model is a classical one, and considers a performance criterion which is a mix between Quality of Service (QoS) and economical cost. We first propose the general framework of the model and discuss the link with dynamical DARP, next describe the algorithm and end with numerical experiments. © 2012 Polish Info Processing Socit.",,"Algorithmic solutions; Constraint propagation; Constraint propagation technique; Economical Costs; Numerical experiments; Performance criterion; Real time; Computer science; Information systems; Quality of service; Algorithms",,,,,"Karp, M.R., (1972) Reducibility among Combinatorial Problems, pp. 85-103. , R.

It is focused in interurban services because it is a growing problem in most of major cities, yet new in the literature. The layout of interurban bus routes and the locations of transfer stations in the main city are the key factors to provide a competitive public transportation service to commuters in a metropolitan area. The number of commuters in huge urban concentrations is growing due to the difficulties of living near the city center. The objective function of the first level is defined with the aim of reducing user and agency costs. In the second level the performance of users is addressed. Furthermore, a local search method based on the Tabu Search algorithm was carried out to guide the exploration in the solution domain. The results obtained in a set of test problems have demonstrated that the restart parameters of the algorithm play a significant role in the efficiency of the algorithm.

The demand responsive transport systems (DRTS) seem to be the solution for the trade-off between flexibility and efficiency. They require the planning of travel paths (routing) and customers pick-up and drop-off times (scheduling) according to received requests and respecting the limited capacity of the fleet and time constraints (hard time windows) for each network's node. Even considering invariable conditions of the network a DRTS may operate according to a static or to a dynamic mode. In the dynamic mode, customers' requests arrive when the service is already running and, consequently, the solution may change over time. In this work, we use an algorithm able to solve a dynamic multi-vehicle DaRP by managing incoming transport demand as fast as possible. The heuristics is a greedy method that tries to assign the requests to one of the fleet's vehicles finding each time the local optimum. The usage of vehicles only when strictly necessary, provides to costs minimization. The work is enriched by a series of tests with different values of the fleet's vehicles and their capacity, of time windows and of incoming requests' number. The solutions provided by the heuristics are simulated in a discrete events environment in which it's possible to reproduce the movement of the buses, the passengers' arrival to the stops, and in the next step the delays due to the traffic congestion and possible anomalies in the behaviour of the passengers. Finally, at the end of the simulation, a set of performance indicators evaluate the solution planned by the heuristics. © 2012 IFAC.","Demand responsive transport systems; Dial-a-Ride Problem; Discrete event simulation; Heuristics; Public transport","Demand responsive transport systems; Dial-a-ride problem; Discrete events; Dynamic modes; Greedy method; Heuristics; Limited capacity; Local optima; Multi-vehicles; Performance indicators; Public transport; Time constraints; Time windows; Transport demand; Transport systems; Benchmarking; Costs; Discrete event simulation; Fleet operations; Manufacture; Traffic congestion; Transportation",,,,,"Aldaihani, M., Dessouky, M.M., Hybrid scheduling methods for paratransit operations (2003) Computers and Industrial Engineering, 45, pp. 75-96; Beaudry, A., Laporte, G., Melo, T., Nickel, S., Dynamic transportation of patients to hospitals (2010) OR Spectrum, 32, pp. 77-107; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., Dynamic pickup and delivery problems (2010) European Journal of Operational Research, 202, pp. 8-15; Bergvinsdottir, K.B., Larsen, J., Jørgensen, R.M., Solving the dial-a-ride problem using genetic algorithms (2004) IMM-technical Report-2004-20, Informatics and Mathematical Modelling, , Technical University of Denmark; Bodin, L.D., Sexton, T., The multi-vehicle subscriber dial-a-ride problem (1986) TIMS Studies in Management Science, 2, pp. 73-86; Borndörfer, R., Klostermeier, F., Grötschel, M., Küttner, C., Telebus berlin: Vehicle scheduling in a dial-a-ride system (1997) Technical Report SC 97-23, Konrad-zuse-zentrum für Informationstechnik, , Berlin; Brotcorne, L., Laporte, G., Semet, F., Ambulance location and relocation models (2003) European Journal of Operational Research, 147, pp. 451-468; Brown, F., Harris, M.G., Other, A.N., Name of paper (1998) Name of Book in Italics, , Name(s) of editor(s) (ed.) page numbers.

DRP is to take over the passenger from a place of departure to a place of arrival. In the DRP, customers send transportation requests to an operator. A request consists of a specified pickup location and destination location along with a desired departure or arrival time. The ultimate aim is to offer an alternative to displacement optimized individually and collectively. The DRP is classified as NP-hard problem thats why most research has been concentrated on the use of approximate methods to solve it. Indeed the DRP is a multi-criteria problem, the proposed solution of which aims to reduce both route duration in response to a certain quality of service provided. In this work, we offer our contribution to the study and solving the DRP in the application using the MOSA algorithm. Tests show competitive results on (Cordeau and Laporte, 2003a) benchmark datasets while improving processing times. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

FTS aim to provide passengers with flexibility in choosing routes, times, modes of transport, service provider and payment systems. In order to achieve this additional flexibility, a well-designed FTS integrate different modes of transport, possibly spanning multiple service providers, to provide more sophisticated, comfortable and cost-effective transport opportunities. The concept of flexible transport is not new; many existing systems, including shared taxicabs, Dial-A-Ride services, and car-clubs, contain elements of such a system. In this paper, we concentrate on FTS within rural areas, which generally suffer from lack of service availability and demand uncertainties, and for which existing FTS solutions are not well suited. We present an agent-based flexible transport systems platform developed using argumentation theory. Formal argumentation is a powerful technique borrowed from artificial intelligence, and in this context is used to weigh-up the conflicting choices available to both passengers and service providers. The resultant platform for FTS in rural areas acts as a virtual transport market place that would more effectively match existing demand and supply for transport services than existing solutions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Argumentation theory; Flexible transport systems; Rural transport",,,,,,"Ambrosino, G., Logi, F., Sassoli, P., EBusiness Applications to flexible transport and mobility services (2001) Eunite Einite conference, Tenerife, Spain, December 2001; Attanasio, A., Cordeau, J.F., Ghiani, G., Laporte, G., Parallel Tabu search heuristics for the dynamic multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2004) Parallel Computing, 30, pp. 377-387; Baroni, P., Giacomin, M., On principle-based evaluation of extension-based argumentation semantics (2007) Artificial Intelligence, 171 (10-15), pp. 675-700; Bent, R., Van Hentenryck, P., A two-stage hybrid algorithm for pickup and delivery vehicle routing problems with time windows (2006) Computers and Operations Research, 33 (4), pp. 875-893; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A hybrid Tabu search and constraint programming algorithm for the dynamic dial-a-ride problem (2010) CIRRELT Report; Chen, S., Tsai, F., Generating fuzzy rules from training instances for fuzzy classification systems (2008) Expert Systems with Applications, 35, pp. 611-621; Cordeau, J.-F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54, pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J.-F., Gendreau, M., Laporte, G., A Tabu search heuristic for periodic and multi-depot vehicle routing problems (1997) Networks, 30, pp. 105-119; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem: variants, modeling issues and algorithms (2002) Journal of the Belgian, French and Italian Operations Research Societies, pp. 89-101; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A Tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research B, 37, pp. 579-594; Coslovich, L., Pesenti, R., Ukovich, W., A two-phase insertion technique of unexpected customers for a dynamic dial-a-ride problem (2006) European Journal of Operational Research, 175, pp. 1605-1615; De Weerdt, M.M., van der Krogt, R.P., Witteveen, C., Resource based multi agent plan merging: framework and application (2003) Proceedings of the 22nd Annual Workshop of the UK Planning and Scheduling Special Interest Group, pp. 218-233; Desrosiers, J., Dumas, Y., Soumis, F., A dynamic programming solution of the large-scale single vehicle dial-a-ride problem with time windows (1986) American Journal of Mathematical and Management Sciences, 6, pp. 301-325; Dung, P.M., On the acceptability of arguments and its fundamental role in nonmonotonic reasoning and logic programming and n-person games (1995) Artificial Intelligence, 77, pp. 321-357; Eloranta, P., Masson, B., The FAMS approach in Angus (2004) Demand Responsive Transport Services: Towards the Flexible Mobility Agency, pp. 269-277. , ENEA, Rome, G.

This problem is characterized by the presence of heterogeneous vehicles and patients. In our problem, two types of vehicles are used, each providing a different capacity for four different modes of transportation. Patients may request to be transported either seated, on a stretcher or in a wheelchair. In addition, some may require accompanying persons. The problem is to construct a minimum-cost routing plan satisfying service-related criteria, expressed in terms of time windows, as well as driver-related constraints expressed in terms of maximum route duration limits and mandatory lunch breaks. We introduce both a three-index and a set-partitioning formulation of the problem. The linear programming relaxation of the latter is solved by a column generation algorithm. We also propose a variable neighborhood search heuristic. Finally, we integrate the heuristic and the column generation approach into a collaborative framework. The column generation algorithm and the collaborative framework provide tight lower bounds on the optimal solution values for small-to-medium-sized instances. The variable neighborhood search algorithm yields high-quality solutions for realistic test instances. © 2010 The Author(s).","Column generation; Dial-a-ride-problem; Passenger transportation; Variable neighborhood search",,,,,,"Beaudry, A., Laporte, G., Melo, T., Nickel, S., Dynamic transportation of patients to hospitals (2009) OR Spectrum, 32, pp. 77-107; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Gribkovskaia, I., Laporte, G., Static pickup and delivery problems: a classification scheme and survey (2007) Top, 15, pp. 1-31; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Dynamic pickup and delivery problems (2010) Eur J Oper Res, 202, pp. 8-15; Černy, V., Thermodynamical approach to the traveling salesman problem: An efficient simulation algorithm (1985) J Opt Theory Appl, 45, pp. 41-51; Cordeau, J.-F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Oper Res, 54, pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transport Res B Meth, 37, pp. 579-594; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem: models and algorithms (2007) Ann Oper Res, 153, pp. 29-46; Danna, E., Lepape, C., Branch-and-price heuristics: a case study on the vehicle routing problem with time windows (2005) Column Generation, pp. 99-129. , G.

It can be used as a tool for understanding and study how different designs, and different ways to operate a dial-a-ride service, affect the performance and efficiency of the service. The system simulates the operation of a dynamic dial-a-ride service that operates with multiple fleets of vehicles with different capacities, schedules and depots. It can be used to investigate how the setting of service and cost parameters and the design of the service affect the total cost for the operator and level of service for the customer. We describe the different modules in the system and the possible uses of the system. A short simulation study is performed to exemplify how it can be used. In this study the effects of including costs for customer discomfort are evaluated. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","DARP; Dial-a-ride; Simulation","Cost parameters; DARP; Dial-a-Ride; Level of Service; Modeling systems; Simulation; Simulation studies; Total costs; Mechanical engineering; Transportation; Costs",,,,,"Attanasio, A., Cordeau, J., Ghiani, G., Laporte, G., Parallel tabu search heuristics for the dynamic multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2004) Parallel Comput, 30, pp. 377-387; Bailey, W., Clark, T., A simulation analysis of demand and fleet size effects on taxicab service rates (1987) WSC'87: Proceedings of the 19th Conference on Winter Simulation, pp. 838-844; Baugh, J., Kakivaya, G., Stone, J., Intractability of the dial-a-ride problem and a multiobjective solution using simulated annealing (1998) Eng Optim, 30, pp. 91-123; Beaudry, A., Laporte, G., Melo, T., Nickel, S., Dynamic transportation of patients in hospitals (2010) OR Spektrum, 32, pp. 77-107; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J., Laporte, G., Dynamic pickup and delivery problems (2010) Eur J Oper Res, 202, pp. 8-15; Borndörfer, R., Grötschel, M., Klostermeier, F., Küttner, C., (1997) Telebus Berlin: Vehicle scheduling in a dial-a-ride system, , Technical report SC 97-23, Konrad-Zuse-Zentrum für Informationstechnik, Berlin; Colorni, A., Righini, G., Modeling and optimizing dynamic dial-a-ride problems (2001) Int Trans Oper Res, 8, pp. 155-166; Cordeau, J., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Oper Res, 54, pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem (DARP): variants, modeling issues and algorithms (2003) 4or, 1, pp. 89-101; Cordeau, J., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transp Res, Part B, 37, pp. 579-594; Cordeau, J., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem: models and algorithms (2007) Ann Oper Res, 153, pp. 29-46; Cordeau, J., Laporte, G., Potvin, J., Savelsbergh, M., (2004) Transportation on demand, , Technical report CRT-2004-25, Centre For Research on Transportation; Deflorio, F., Chiara, B.D., Murro, A., Simulation and performance of DRTS in a realistic environment (2002) Proceedings of the 13th Mini-Euro Conference Handling Uncertainty in the Analysis of Traffic and Transportation Systems and the 9th Meeting of the Euro Working Group on Transportation Intermodality, Sustainability and Intelligent Transport Systems, pp. 622-628; Diana, M., Dessouky, M., Xia, N., A model for the fleet sizing of demand responsive transportation services with time windows (2006) Transp Res, Part B, 40, pp. 651-666; Fu, L., Scheduling dial-a-ride paratransit under time-varying, stochastic congestion (2002) Transp Res, Part B, 36, pp. 485-506; Fu, L., A simulation model for evaluating advanced dial-a-ride paratransit systems (2002) Transp Res, Part A, 36, pp. 291-307; Fu, L., Teply, S., On-line and off-line routing and scheduling of dial-a-ride paratransit vehicles (1999) Comput-Aided Civ Infrastruct Eng, 14, pp. 309-319; Gerrard, M., Comparison of taxi and dial-a-bus services (1974) Transp Sci, 8, pp. 85-101; Häll, C., Andersson, H., Lundgren, J., Värbrand, P., The integrated dial-a-ride problem (2009) Public Transp, 1, pp. 39-54; Haugland, D., Ho, S., Feasibility testing for dial-a-ride problems (2010) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 6124, pp. 170-179. , B.

The hybrid algorithm combines an exact constraint programming algorithm and a tabu search heuristic. An important component of the tabu search heuristic consists of three scheduling procedures that are executed sequentially. Experiments show that the constraint programming algorithm is sometimes able to accept or reject incoming requests, and that the hybrid method outperforms each of the two algorithms when they are executed alone.","Constraint programming; Dial-a-ride problem; Dynamic; Scheduling; Tabu search","Constraint programming; Dial-a-ride problem; Exact constraint; Hybrid algorithms; Hybrid method; Hybrid tabu search; Real time; Service requests; Tabu Search heuristic; Computer programming; Constraint theory; Dynamics; Heuristic algorithms; Scheduling; Tabu search",,,,,"Attanasio, A., Cordeau, J.-F., Ghiani, G., Laporte, G., Parallel tabu search heuristics for the dynamic multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2004) Parallel Comput., 30 (3), pp. 377-387; Beaudry, A., Laporte, G., Melo, T., Nickel, S., Dynamic transportation of patients in hospitals (2010) OR Spectrum, 32 (1), pp. 77-107; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Dynamic pickup and delivery problems (2010) Eur.

This paper addresses a variant of the DARP where requests can change of vehicle during their trip. This transshipment is made on specific locations called ""transfer points"". The corresponding problem is called the Dial-A-Ride Problem with Transfers (DARPT). Solving the DARPT yields modeling and algorithmic difficulties. In this paper, we focus on efficiently checking the feasibility of routes with regards to the problem temporal constraints in a Large Neighborhood Search. This feasibility problem is a Simple Temporal Problem, well studied in particular in Artificial Intelligence [8].

There have been different modifications made to the generic tabu search in recent years to achieve better performances. Among those reviewed in the introduction of this paper, the adaptive tabu search (ATS) has incorporated the backtracking and the adaptive search radius mechanisms that help accelerate the search and release it from a local solution lock. The paper explains an enhancement made to the ATS to accomplish multipath ATS (MATS) algorithms. Performances of the ATS and the MATS are evaluated using surface optimization problems, and results are presented in the paper. Finally, the MATS is applied to solve a real-world vehicle control problem.

A potential solution for this problem is the use of car polling systems, which support the process of car sharing among users. However, current systems only work as a channel where providers and consumers can arrange shared cars for public transport. This work extends this idea via the use of DARP (Dial-a-Ride Problem) and metaheuristic concepts so that the allocation of rides can be carried out in an autonomous and dynamic way. The main aim of this approach is to optimize and facilitate the sharing process of personal cars, so that the number of vehicles in the roads can be reduced together with all the problems that such vehicles raise on. © 2005 IEEE.","DARP; Metaheuristics; Optimization","Car pooling; Current system; DARP; Dial-a-ride problem; Meta heuristics; Metaheuristic; Number of vehicles; Polling system; Potential solutions; Public transport; Traffic jams; Emergency traffic control; Traffic congestion; Optimization",,,,,"Hennessy, D.A., Wiesenthal, D.L., Kohn, P.M., The influence of traffic congestion, daily hassles, and trait stress susceptibility on state driver stress: An interactive perspective (2000) Journal of Applied Biobehavioral Research, 5 (2), pp. 162-179; Vlacic, L., Parent, M., Harashima, F., (2001) Telligent Vehicle Technologies, , London: Butterworth-Heinemann; Parent, M., Automated public vehicles : A first step towards the automated highway (1997) Proceedings of 4th World Congress on Intelligent Transport Systems, , Berlin, Germany; Bodin, L.D., Sexton, T., The multi-vehicle subscriber dial-a-ride problem (1986) TIMS Studies in Management Science, 2, pp. 73-86; Baber, J., Kolodko, J., Noel, T., Parent, M., Vlacic, L., Cooperative autonomous driving - Intelligent vehicles sharing city roads (2005) IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine, 12 (1), pp. 44-49; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 37 (6), pp. 579-594; Mauri, G.B., Novas Abordagens para Representação e Obtenção de Limitantes e Soluções para Alguns Problemas de Otimização Combinatória (2008) Tese de Doutorado em Computação Aplicada, , Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais - INPE; (2011), http://www-01.ibm.com/software/integration/optimization/cplex-optimizer/, IBM IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimizer Disponível em; Cordeau, J.F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54 (3), pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., The Dial-a-Ride Problem (DARP): Variants, modeling issues and algorithms (2003) Quarterly Journal of the Belgian, French and Italian Operations Research Societies, 1 (2), pp. 89-101; Jorgensen, R.M., Bergvinsdottir, K.B., Larsen, J., Solving the diala-ride problem using genetic algorithms (2006) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 58 (10), pp. 1321-1331; Glover, F., Kochenberger, G., (2003) Handbook of Metaheuristics, , Springer, New York, Boston, Dordrecht, London, Moscow; Souza, M.J.F., (2009) Teligência Computacional Para Otimização, , Ouro Preto, MG; Silva, M.S.A., Mine, M.T., Ochi, L.S., Busca Local Iterada Aplicada ao Problema de Programação de Jogos Realizados em Dois Turnos Espelhados (2006) Anais Do XXXVIII Simpósio Brasileiro de Pesquisa Operacional; Silva, M.S., (2009) Problema de Recobrimento de Rotas Com Coleta de Prêmios, , Dissertação de Mestrado, Universidade Federal Fluminense, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil; Kumar, V., Algorithms for Constraint-satisfaction problems: A Survey (1992) AI Magazine, 13 (1), pp. 32-44; Ghallab, M., Nau, D., Traverso, P., (2004) Automated Planning: Theory and Practice, , Morgan Kaufmann Publishers","Leite Viana Costa, D.; Universidade Federal da Paraiba (UFPB), Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil; email: dlvcpe@gmail.com",,,,,,,,15480992,,,,"Portuguese","IEEE.

This optimization model presented in earlier studies, is considered in this study. Due to the non-linear nature of the objective function the traditional optimization methods are plagued with the problem of converging to a local minima. To overcome this pitfall we use metaheuristics namely Simulated Annealing (SA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Artificial Immune System (AIS). From the results obtained, we conclude that Artificial Immune System method effectively tackles this optimization problem by providing us with optimal solutions. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Solution approaches are developed for the single-vehicle and two-vehicle cases. The fact that for each cargo that goes from a node i to another node j there may be a cargo going in the opposite direction provides the motivation for the two-vehicle case, because one may conceivably consider solutions where no cargoes that travel in opposite directions between node pairs are carried by the same vehicle. Yet, it is shown that such scenarios are generally sub-optimal. As expected, the computational effort of the single vehicle algorithm is exponential in the number of cargoes. For the two-vehicle case, said effort is of an order of magnitude that is not higher than that of the single-vehicle case. Some rudimentary examples are presented or both the single-vehicle and two-vehicle cases so as to better illustrate the method. © 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Three heuristic algorithms based on sequential insertion, parallel insertion, and clustering first-routing second are proposed to solve this problem within a reasonable time for implementation in a real-world situation. The results of the three heuristic methods are compared with the results obtained from exact solution by CPLEX to validate and evaluate the three heuristic algorithms.

In dynamic DARP, transportation requests are received in real time, whereas in static DARP, all information about service requests is known in advance. The main objective for the DARP heuristics is to minimize the number of vehicles used to satisfy all trip requests, subject to service quality constraints. Two online implementation strategies, called ""immediate insertion"" and ""rolling-horizon insertion,"" coupled with two variations of the insertion heuristic rejected reinsertion without and with periodic improvement procedures, are developed and compared. Computational results show that the rolling-horizon insertion heuristics, which take advantage of the advance information available, achieve vehicle reductions of up to 10% more than their immediate-insertion counterpart. The proposed online rejected-reinsertion heuristics achieve vehicle reductions up to 16% and 10% more, respectively, than the online parallel insertion heuristics that use immediate insertion and rolling-horizon insertion strategies, while keeping the computation time at the same magnitude as the parallel-insertion heuristics. Sensitivity analysis shows that the rolling-horizon insertion heuristics are insensitive to the time horizon and the rolling interval.",,"Computation time; Computational results; Dial-a-ride problem; Insertion heuristics; Multi-vehicles; Number of vehicles; Online implementation; Real time; Service Quality; Service requests; Time horizons; Quality of service; Sensitivity analysis",,,,,"Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The dial-A-ride problem: Variants, modeling issues and algorithms (2003) 4OR, Quarterly Journal of the Belgian, French and Italian Operations Research Societies, 1 (2), pp. 89-101. , June; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The dial-A-ride problem: Models and algorithms (2007) Annals of Operations Research, 153, pp. 29-46; Bodin, L., Golden, B.L., Assad, A., Ball, M., Routing and scheduling of vehicles and crews: The state of the art (1983) Computers and Operations Research, 10 (2), pp. 63-211; Solomon, M., Algorithms for the vehicle routing and scheduling problems with time window constraints (1987) Operations Research, 35 (2), pp. 254-265; Desrosiers, J., Dumas, Y., Solomon, M.M., Soumis, F., Time constrained routing and scheduling (1995) Network Routing, Handbooks in Operations Research and Management Science, 8, pp. 35-139. , (M.

In this paper we analyze the corresponding problem arising in the daily operation of the Austrian Red Cross. This nongovernmental organization is the largest organization performing patient transportation in Austria. The aim is to design vehicle routes to serve partially dynamic transportation requests using a fixed vehicle fleet. Each request requires transportation from a patient's home location to a hospital (outbound request) or back home from the hospital (inbound request). Some of these requests are known in advance. Some requests are dynamic in the sense that they appear during the day without any prior information. Finally, some inbound requests are stochastic. More precisely, with a certain probability each outbound request causes a corresponding inbound request on the same day. Some stochastic information about these return transports is available from historical data. The purpose of this study is to investigate, whether using this information in designing the routes has a significant positive effect on the solution quality. The problem is modeled as a dynamic stochastic dial-a-ride problem with expected return transports. We propose four different modifications of metaheuristic solution approaches for this problem. In detail, we test dynamic versions of variable neighborhood search (VNS) and stochastic VNS (S-VNS) as well as modified versions of the multiple plan approach (MPA) and the multiple scenario approach (MSA). Tests are performed using 12 sets of test instances based on a real road network. Various demand scenarios are generated based on the available real data. Results show that using the stochastic information on return transports leads to average improvements of around 15%. Moreover, improvements of up to 41% can be achieved for some test instances. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

It is included in the family of the vehicle routing with profit problems in which a set of vehicle tours are constructed. The objective is to find a set of cycles in the vehicle tours that maximize the collection of profits minus travel costs, subject to constraints limiting the length of cycles that profit is available on arcs. To solve this variant we adopted two metaheuristics based on adaptive memory. We show that our algorithms provide good results in terms of solution quality and running times. © 2011 Operational Research Society Ltd.

Although car pooling is becoming more common, in practice, participant matching results are still being obtained by an inefficient manual approach, which may possibly result in an inferior solution. In the past, when car pooling studies have been done the problem has been treated as either a to-work problem (from different origins to the same destination) or return-from-work problem (from the same origin to different destinations). However, in this study we employ a time-space network flow technique to develop a model for the many-to-many car pooling problem with multiple vehicle types and person types. The model is formulated as an integer multiple commodity network flow problem. Since real problem sizes can be huge, it could be difficult to find optimal solutions within a reasonable period of time. Therefore, we develop a solution algorithm based on Lagrangian relaxation, a subgradient method, and a heuristic for the upper bound solution, to solve the model. To test how well the model and the solution algorithm can be applied to real world, we randomly generated several examples based upon data reported from a past study carried out in northern Taiwan, on which we performed numerical tests. The test results show the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution algorithm. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Car pooling; Lagrangian relaxation; Many-to-many; Multiple commodity network flow problem;

The ambulance central station of the Hospital Complex has to plan the transportation demands between care units which require a vehicle. Some demands are known in advance and the others arise dynamically. Each demand requires a specific type of vehicle and a vehicle can transport only one person at a time. The demands can be subcontracted to a private company which implies high cost. Moreover, transportations are subject to particular constraints, among them priority of urgent demands, disinfection of a vehicle after the transportation of a patient with contagious disease and respect of the type of vehicle needed. These characteristics involve a distinction between the vehicles and the crews during the modeling phase. We propose a modeling for solving this difficult problem and a tabu search algorithm inspired by Gendreau et al. (1999). This method supports an adaptive memory and a tabu search procedure. Computational experiments on a real-life instance and on randomly generated instances show that the method can provide high-quality solutions for this dynamic problem with a short computation time. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The problem arises from an on-demand transportation system developed in a rural zone in France, where the objective of encouraging people meeting is pursued. We address the solution of the problem with a column generation approach, applied to a set partitioning formulation where the objective function is fractional. Based on the literature on linear fractional programming, two methods are developed to deal with this fractional objective. Experiments permit to compare these two approaches and to evaluate the impact of the new objective compared to a standard min-cost or min-time optimization. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The running time of the procedure is O(n5), compared to O(n6) for a straightforward approach. For solving the problem we embed the suggested evaluation procedure in a pure local search heuristic and in a tabu search heuristic. The quality of the solutions obtained by the two heuristics have been compared experimentally.

The core of a DARP is a pick and delivery routing with multiple vehicles in which customers have ride-time constraints and routes have a maximum duration. This paper considers DARPs for which the objective is to minimize the routing cost, a complex optimization problem which has been studied extensively in the past. State-of-the-art approaches include sophisticated tabu search and variable neighborhood search. This paper presented a simple constraint-based large neighborhood search, which uses constraint programming repeatedly to find good reinsertions for randomly selected sets of customers.

A fleet of vehicles, without fixed routes and schedules, carries people from their pickup points to their delivery points, during a pre-specified time interval. It can be modeled as an -hard routing and scheduling problem, with a suitable mixed integer programming formulation. Exact approaches to this problem are too limited to tackle real-life instances: time dependent network, requests received on-line, different objective functions. In this paper we propose an algorithm to solve the off-line Dial-a-Ride Problem (darp), based on a Granular Tabu Search method.

In many cases the solution is to realize demand responsive transportation system. A Demand Responsive Transport System (DRTS) requires the planning of travel paths (routing) and customer pick-up and drop-off times (scheduling) according to received requests. In particular, the problem has to deal with multiple vehicles, limited capacity of the fleet vehicles and temporal constraints (time windows). A DRTS may operate according to static or dynamic mode. In the static setting, all the customer requests are known beforehand and the DRTS solves a Dial-a-Ride Problem (DaRP) instance, to produce the tour of each bus, respecting the pick up and delivery time windows while minimising the solution cost. In the dynamic mode, the customer requests arrive overtime to a control station and, consequently, the solution may also change over time. In this work, we address a Demand Responsive Transport System capable of managing incoming transport demand using a two-stage algorithm by solving a DaRP instance. The solutions provided by the heuristics are simulated in a discrete events environment in which it is possible to reproduce the movement of the buses, the passengers' arrival to the stops, the delays due to the traffic congestion and possible anomalies in the behaviour of the passengers.

Indeed, different versions of the dynamic Dial a Ride Problem are found in every day practice; transportation of people in low-density areas, transportation of the handicapped and elderly persons and parcel pick-up and delivery service in urban areas. The problem is to affect every new passenger request to one of the vehicles and to design a new route and schedule for this vehicle. This affectation must be done in real time. In this work, we offer our contribution to the study and solving the dynamic DRP in the application using the MOSA algorithm. Numerical results show the benefits of this algorithm in a real-time context. © 2011 IEEE.","Dial a Ride Problem; Heuristics; Multi-Criteria Optimization; Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing Algorithm; Passenger Transportation","Dial-a-ride problem; Heuristics; Multi objective; Multicriteria optimization; Passenger transportation; Algorithms; Computer simulation; Mathematical models; Multiobjective optimization; Simulated annealing",,,,,"Toth, P., Vigo, D., The Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls (2002) SIAM Monographs on Discrete Mathematics and Applications, pp. 195-224. , P.

Consequently, travel time, number of stops, unexpected delays, transport costs, level of air pollution, noise, and traffic accidents are increased. In addition to daily congestion, there may be congestion and traffic jams as a consequence of reconstruction of the roads' lanes. During the past decade, different strategies for transport demand management have been developed, with the aim to decrease existing traffic congestion. One of the available strategies is a ride matching (sharing) concept. This strategy means that several participants share only one private car when traveling from origin to destination. A model for grouping drivers into cars for ride matching, according to similarities of a place of living and working, working hours, and type of car license plate, is developed in this paper. The writers apply the ride matching concept on congested traffic during the reconstruction of the main bridge in Belgrade, Serbia, which is the Gazela Bridge. The basis of the proposed model is the K-means method and even-odd concept. To solve the ride matching problem, the writers present improvement of the traditional K-means algorithm, in which the numbers of centers is unknown in advance and the number of clusters may not be the same as the number of centers. This modification of the traditional K-means algorithm, called advanced K-means, for solving a specific ride matching problem is the main contribution of the paper. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Clustering; Even-odd concept; K-means; Ride matching","Belgrade , Serbia; Clustering; Congested traffic; Even-odd concept; K-means; k-Means algorithm; K-means method; Matching problems; Number of centers; Number of clusters; Ride matching; Traffic jams; Transport costs; Transport demand management; Transport networks; Travel time; Working hours; Algorithms; Emergency traffic control; Information dissemination; License plates (automobile); Traffic congestion; algorithm; automobile; bridge construction; cluster analysis; demand-side management; strategic approach; traffic congestion; transportation development; travel demand; urban transport; Belgrade; Serbia",,,,,"Anderberg, M.R., (1973) Cluster analysis for applications, , Academic, London; Blumenberg, E., Smart, M., Getting by with a little help from my friends and family: Immigrants and carpooling (2010) Transportation, 37 (3), pp. 429-446. , TRPOB6, 0049-4488, 10.1007/s11116-010-9262-4; Brownstone, D., Golob, T.F., The effectivness of ridesharing incentives.

An important subproblem arising in dynamic dial-a-ride services can be identified as the single-vehicle DARP, in which the goal is to determine the optimal route for a single vehicle with respect to a generalized objective function. The main result of this work is an adaptive insertion algorithm capable of producing optimal solutions for a time constrained version of this problem, which was first studied by Psaraftis in the early 1980s. The complexity of the algorithm is analyzed and evaluated by means of computational experiments, implying that a significant advantage of the proposed method can be identified as the possibility of controlling computational work smoothly, making the algorithm applicable to any problem size. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

(CAB) based in Massachusetts, a dial-a-ride system has been in operation to serve outpatients such as drug and alcohol addicts requesting both delivery and pickup services through telephone calls. As the number of outpatients continues to increase with constrained vehicle capacity and operating budget, CAB copes with the onerous task of minimising the service disruptions and vehicle operating costs. To handle this challenging task, we developed an integer programming model and a tabu search heuristic for solving that model. A series of computational experiments that we made through the real-world problems encountering CAB substantiated the practicality of the proposed model and tabu search heuristic. In addition, the solution quality (accuracy) and computational efficiency of the tabu search heuristic were verified by comparing its test result to those of the branch and bound algorithm. © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","A dial-a-ride problemtabu; Algorithm development; Healthcare supply chains; Search heuristics",,,,,,"Attanasio, A., Cordeau, J.-F., Ghiani, G., Laporte, G., Parallel tabu search heuristics for the dynamic multi-vehicle dial-A-Ride problem (2004) Parallel Computing, 30 (3), pp. 377-387; Badeau, P., Gendreau, M., Guertin, F., Potvin, J.-Y., Tallard, E., A parallel tabu search heuristic for the vehicle routing problem with time windows (1997) Transportation Research Part C, 5 (2), pp. 109-122; Baugh Jr., J.W., Kakivaya, G.K.R., Stone, J.R., Intractability of the dial-a-ride problem and a multiobjective solution using simulated annealing (1998) Engineering Optimization, 30 (2), pp. 91-123; Bodin, L., Golden, B., Assad, A., Ball, M., Routing and scheduling of vehicles and crews: The state of the art (1983) Computers and Operations Research, 10 (2), pp. 62-212; Braysy, O., Gendreau, M., Tabu search heuristics for the vehicle routing problem with time windows (2001) Technical Report STF42 A01022, SINTEF Applied Mathematics, Research Council of Norway, Oslo, Norway.; Colorni, A., Righini, G., Modeling and optimizing dial-A-Ride problems (2001) International Transactions in Operational Research, 8 (2), pp. 155-166; Cordeau, J-F., Laporte, G., The dial-A-Ride problem (DARP): Variants, modeling issues and algorithms (2003) Quarterly Journal of the Belgian, French, and Italian Operations Research Societies, 1 (2), pp. 89-101; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 37 (6), pp. 579-594. , DOI 10.1016/S0191-2615(02)00045-0; Coslovich, L., Pesenti, R., Ukovich, W., A two-phase insertion technique of unexpected customers for a dynamic dial-a-ride problem (2006) European Journal of Operational Research, 175 (3), pp. 1605-1615. , DOI 10.1016/j.ejor.2005.02.038, PII S0377221705002262; Cremers, M.L.A.G., Haneveld, W.K.K., Van Der Vlerk, M.H., A two stage model for a day-ahead paratransit planning problem (2009) Mathematical Methods of Operations Research, 69 (2), pp. 323-341; De Backer, B., Furnon, V., Kilby, P., Prosser, P., Shaw, P., Solving vehicle routing problems using constraint programming and metaheuristics (2000) Journal of Heuristics, 6 (4), pp. 501-523; Desrosiers Jacques, Dumas Yvan, Soumis Francois, DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING SOLUTION OF THE LARGE-SCALE SINGLE-VEHICLE DIAL-A-RIDE PROBLEM WITH TIME WINDOWS.

Given the fact that people are subject to transportation, constraints related to quality of service are usually present, such as time windows and maximum user ride time limits. In many real world applications, different types of users exist. In the field of patient and disabled people transportation, up to four different transportation modes can be distinguished. In this article we consider staff seats, patient seats, stretchers and wheelchair places. Furthermore, most companies involved in the transportation of the disabled or ill dispose of different types of vehicles. We introduce both aspects into state-of-the-art formulations and branch-and-cut algorithms for the standard dial-a-ride problem. Also a recent metaheuristic method is adapted to this new problem. In addition, a further service quality related issue is analyzed: vehicle waiting time with passengers aboard. Instances with up to 40 requests are solved to optimality. High quality solutions are obtained with the heuristic method. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Branch-and-cut; Dial-a-ride; Heterogeneous fleet; Heterogeneous passengers; Variable neighborhood search","Integer programming; Optimization; Quality of service; Transportation; Vehicles; Branch and cut; Dial-a-Ride; Heterogeneous fleet; Heterogeneous passengers; Variable neighborhood search; Heuristic methods; algorithm; heuristics; modeling; neighborhood; research; transportation mode; travel behavior; location decision; road transport; transportation planning",,,,,"Ascheuer, N., Fischetti, M., Grötschel, M., A polyhedral study of the asymmetric traveling salesman problem with time windows (2000) Networks, 36, pp. 69-79; Balas, E., Fischetti, M., Pulleyblank, W.R., The precedence-constraint asymmetric traveling salesman polytope (1995) Math.

In this paper we develop the first exact algorithm which is able to either efficiently prove the infeasibility or to provide a feasible solution. Such an algorithm could be used in a dynamic setting for determining whether it is possible or not to accept an incoming request. The algorithm includes solution space reduction procedures, and filtering algorithms for some DARP relaxations. Computational results show that the filtering algorithms are effective and that the resulting algorithm is advantageous on the more constrained instances. © 2011 INFORMS.","Algorithms; Constraint programming; Dial-A-Ride problem; Dynamic programming; Partial routes; Scheduling","Algorithms; Computer programming; Constraint theory; Fleet operations; Scheduling; Signal filtering and prediction; Computational results; Constraint programming; Dial-a-ride problem; Dynamic settings; Feasible solution; Filtering algorithm; Fleet of vehicles; Partial routes; Dynamic programming",,,,,"Beaudry, A., Laporte, G., Melo, T., Nickel, S., Dynamic transportation of patients in hospitals (2010) OR Spectrum, 32, pp. 77-107; Beldiceanu, N., Carlsson, M., Rampon, J.-X., (2005) Global Constraint Catalog, , http://www.emn.fr/x-info/sdemasse/gccat, Research Report T2005: 08, Swedish Institute of Computer Science.

The proposed bilevel programming model minimizes the total travel cost of collecting travel time data with probe vehicles. The upper-level model is designed to determine fleet size and feasible schedules, whereas the lower-level model attempts to route vehicles at the least cost. The model in the lower level consists of a total cost objective function and a set of practical constraints, such as number of probe vehicles, number of study roadway segments, and project duration.

The problem requires that any paired pickup and delivery locations have to be served by one vehicle and the pickup location has to be scheduled before the corresponding delivery location in the route. In order to find near-optimal transportation plans, we discuss a hybrid approach mixing branch-and bound techniques and meta-heuristics. The key idea is that an original problem is decomposed into a set of sub-problems, in which the number of customers assigned to each vehicle is fixed, and respective sub-problem is solved by meta-heuristics such as simulated annealing heuristics. Then, promising sub-problems are able to be found efficiently by using branch-and-bound techniques. The effectiveness and the potential of the proposed approach are evaluated by a series of computational experiments. ©2010 TSI Press.","Branch-and-bound algorithm; Decomposition; Pickup and delivery problem; Simulated annealing algorithm","Branch and bounds; Branch-and-bound algorithms; Computational experiment; Hybrid approach; Meta heuristics; Meta-heuristic approach; Pickup and delivery; Pickup and delivery problem; Pickup and delivery problems; Problem decomposition; Simulated annealing algorithm; Sub-problems; Transportation plans; Vehicle Routing Problems; Algorithms; Branch and bound method; Heuristic methods; Pickups; Simulated annealing",,,,,"Pochet, Y., Wolsey, L.A., (2006) Production Planning by Mixed Integer Programming, , Springer; Savelsbergh, M.W.P., Sol, M., The General Pickup and Delivery Problem (1995) Transportation Science, 29, pp. 17-29; Applegate, D.L., Bixby, R.E., Chvatal, V., Cook, W.J., (2007) The Traveling Salesman Problem: A Computational Study, , Princeton Univ.

Dial a Ride Problem (DRP) is to take over the passenger from a place of departure to a place of arrival. It is characterized by a set of transport demands and a number of vehicles available. The ultimate aim is to offer an alternative to displacement optimized individually and collectively. The DRP is classified as NP-hard problem that's why most research has been concentrated on the use of approximate methods to solve it. Indeed, it is a multi-criteria problem, the proposed solution of which aims to reduce both route duration, and cost in response to a certain quality of service provided. In this work, we offer our contribution to the study and solving the DRP in the application using the simulated annealing algorithm. Tests show competitive results on (Cordeau and Laporte, 2003) [4] benchmark datasets while improving processing times.","Dial a Ride Problem; Heuristics; Multi-criteria optimization; Simulated annealing algorithm","Approximate methods; Benchmark datasets; Dial-a-ride problem; Heuristics; Multi objective; Multi-criteria; Multicriteria optimization; NP-HARD problem; Number of vehicles; Processing time; Simulated annealing algorithm; Simulated annealing algorithms; Transport demand; Algorithms; Annealing; Approximation theory; Computational complexity; Quality of service; Simulated annealing",,,,,"Coja-Oghlan, A., Krumke, S.O., Nierhoff, T., A hard dial-a-ride problem that is easy on average (2005) USA Journal of Scheduling, 8 (3), pp. 197-210. , Kluwer Academic Publishers Hingham, MA (June); Gendreau, M., Guertin, F., Potvin, J.-Y., (2006) Neighborhood Search Heuristics for a Dynamic Vehicle Dispatching Problem with Pick-Ups and Deliveries Tranportation, Research Part C, 14 (2006), pp. 157-174; Bergvinsdottir, K.B., The genetic algorithm for solving the dial-a-ride problem (2004) Master Thesis of Science in Engineering.

These problems are generally treated via the representation of the road network as a weighted complete graph. Each arc of the graph represents the shortest route for a possible origin-destination connection. Several attributes can be defined for one arc (travel time, travel cost, etc.), but the shortest route modeled by this arc is computed according to a single criterion, generally travel time. Consequently, some alternative routes proposing a different compromise between the attributes of the arcs are discarded from the solution space. We propose to consider these alternative routes and to evaluate their impact on solution algorithms and solution values through a multigraph representation of the road network. We point out the difficulties brought by this representation for general vehicle routing problems, which drives us to introduce the so-called fixed sequence arc selection problem (FSASP). We propose a dynamic programming solution method for this problem. In the context of an on-demand transportation (ODT) problem, we then propose a simple insertion algorithm based on iterative FSASP solving and a branch-and-price exact method. Computational experiments on modified instances from the literature and on realistic data issued from an ODT system in the French Doubs Central area underline the cost savings brought by the proposed methods using the multigraph model. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We propose a competitive variable neighborhood search-based heuristic, using three classes of neighborhoods. The first neighborhood class uses simple swap operations tailored to the dial-a-ride problem; the second neighborhood class is based on the ejection chain idea; and the third neighborhood class exploits the existence of arcs where the vehicle load is zero, giving rise to natural sequences of requests.

Many do not operate vehicles themselves; instead, they contract out the provision of services. Contractors are paid for each hour of service. They are responsible for hiring crew, forming routes, dispatching, and operating and maintaining agency-owned vehicles. In the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, Metro Mobility, the agency responsible for providing paratransit services, requires contractors to use agency-approved software for booking trips dynamically and sets parameters that guide contractors' practices. Customer trips booked in this fashion may not utilize capacity in the most efficient manner. Therefore, beginning with the daily trip schedules generated by the software, this paper proposes two approaches for improving the efficiency of paratransit operations and estimates the benefit of using these approaches via experiments that utilize Metro Mobility data. The first approach re-optimizes routes developed at the end of each day. The second approach evaluates the benefit to state agencies of selectively using non-dedicated service providers such as taxis. Both approaches are tested on actual data obtained from Metro Mobility. The study shows that a conservative estimate of savings from re-optimization would be approximately 5% of Metro Mobility's operating costs. Savings from the use of taxis are smaller and in the range of hundreds of dollars per day. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, it has improved 45% and 81.7% of the best solutions on the 200 and 600-customer benchmarks, sometimes by as much as 3 vehicles.

These shipping companies are committed to carrying some contract cargoes and will try to derive additional revenue from optional spot cargoes. An efficient tabu search algorithm has been developed to ensure quick decision support for the planners. The solutions generated by the tabu search heuristic are compared with those produced by a previously published multi-start local search heuristic. Computational results show that the tabu search heuristic yields optimal or near-optimal solutions to real-life instances within reasonable time. For large and tigthly constrained cases, the tabu search heuristic provides much better solutions than the multi-start local search heuristic. A version of the tabu search heuristic will be integrated as an improved solver in a prototype decision support system used by several shipping companies. © 2010 Operational Research Society Ltd.

The cargo quantities are often flexible within an interval. Therefore, interwoven with the routing and scheduling decisions, the planner also has to decide the optimal cargo quantities.

Here, we add the flexibility of providing the option for passengers to transfer from one vehicle to another at specific locations. As part of the mathematical formulation, we include transfer nodes where vehicles may interact interchanging passengers. Additional variables to keep track of customers along their route are considered. The formulation has been proven to work correctly, and by means of a simple example instance, we conclude that there exist some configurations in which a scheme allowing transfers results in better quality optimal solutions. Finally, a solution method based on Benders decomposition is addressed. We compare the computational effort of this application with a straight branch and bound strategy; we also provide insights to develop more efficient set partitioning formulations and associated algorithms for solving real-size problems. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The problem requires that any paired pickup and delivery locations have to be served by one vehicle and the pickup location has to be scheduled before the corresponding delivery location in the route. In order to find near-optimal transportation plans, we discuss a hybrid approach mixing branch-and bound techniques and meta-heuristics. The key idea is that an original problem is decomposed into a set of sub-problems, in which the number of customers assigned to each vehicle is fixed, and respective sub-problem is solved by meta-heuristics such as simulated annealing heuristics. Then, promising sub-problems are able to be found efficiently by using branch-and-bound techniques. The effectiveness and the potential of the proposed approach are evaluated by a series of computational experiments. © 2010 SICE.","Branch-and-bound algorithm; Decomposition; Pickup and delivery problem; Simulated annealing algorithm","Branch and bound method; Decomposition; Location; Pickups; Simulated annealing; Vehicles; Branch and bound techniques; Branch-and-bound algorithms; Computational experiment; Pickup and delivery problems; Problem decomposition; Simulated annealing algorithms; Simulated annealing method; Vehicle Routing Problems; Vehicle routing",,,,,"Pochet, Y., Wolsey, L.A., (2006) Production Planning by Mixed Integer Programming, , Springer; Savelsbergh, M.W.P., Sol, M., The general pickup and delivery problem (1995) Transportation Science, 29, pp. 17-29; Lawler, E.L., Lenstra, J.K., Rinnooy-Kan, A.H.G., Shmoys, D.B., (1985) The Traveling Salesman Problem, , editors, John Wiley & Sons; Reeves, C.R., (1993) Modern Heuristics Techniques for Combinatorial Problems, , (editor), John Wiley & Sons, Inc; Preux, P., Talbi, E., Toward hybrid evolutionary algorithms (1999) International Transaction of Operational Research, 6, pp. 557-570; K.

The focus is on a decision to make one day ahead: which requests to serve with own vehicles and which ones to assign to subcontractors under uncertainty of late requests that are gradually revealed during the day of operation. We call this problem the dynamic day-ahead paratransit planning problem. The developed model is a nonstandard two-stage recourse model in which ideas from stochastic programming and online optimization are combined: in the first stage, clustered requests are assigned to vehicles, and in the dynamic secondstage problem, an event-driven simulation is used to cluster the late requests once they are revealed and subsequently assign them to vehicles. A genetic algorithm is used to solve the model. Computational results are presented for randomly generated data sets. Furthermore, a comparison is made to a similar problem we studied earlier in which the simplifying but unrealistic assumption has been made that all late requests are revealed at the beginning of the day of operation. © The authors 2010.

The aim is to provide an efficient and timely transport service to patients between several locations in a hospital campus. Transportation requests arrive in a dynamic fashion and the solution methodology must therefore be capable of quickly inserting new requests in the current vehicle routes. Contrary to standard dial-a-ride problems, the problem under study includes several complicating constraints which are specific to a hospital context. The study provides a detailed description of the problem and proposes a two-phase heuristic procedure capable of handling its many features. In the first phase a simple insertion scheme is used to generate a feasible solution, which is improved in the second phase with a tabu search algorithm. The heuristic procedure was extensively tested on real data provided by a German hospital. Results show that the algorithm is capable of handling the dynamic aspect of the problem and of providing high-quality solutions. In particular, it succeeded in reducing waiting times for patients while using fewer vehicles. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Dial-a-ride; Dynamic mode; In-house hospital transportation; Tabu search",,,,,,"Aldaihani, M., Dessouky, M., Hybrid scheduling methods for paratransit operations (2003) Comput Ind Eng, 45, pp. 75-96; Attanasio, A., Cordeau, J.-F., Ghiani, G., Laporte, G., Parallel tabu search heuristics for the dynamic multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2004) Parallel Comput, 30, pp. 377-387; Banerjea-brodeur, M., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Lasry, A., Scheduling linen deliveries in a large hospital (1998) J Oper Res Soc, 49, pp. 777-780; Baugh, J., Krishna, G., Kakivaya, R., Stone, J., Intractability of the dial-a-ride problem and a multiobjective solution using simulated annealing (1998) Eng Optim, 30, pp. 91-123; Bent, R., van hentenryck, P., A two-stage hybrid algorithm for pickup and delivery vehicle routing problems with time windows (2006) Comput Oper Res, 33, pp. 875-893; Bodin, L.D., Sexton, T., The multi-vehicle subscriber dial-a-ride problem (1986) TIMS Stud Manage Sci, 22, pp. 73-86; Borndörfer, R., Grötschel, M., Klostermeister, F., Küttner, C., (1997) Telebus Berlin: Vehicle Scheduling in a Dial-a-Ride System, , http://www.zib.de/PaperWeb/abstracts/SC-97-23, Technical Report SC 97-23, Konrad-Zuse-Zentrum für Informationstechnik Berlin, Germany.

The problem requires that any paired pickup and delivery locations have to be served by one vehicle and the pickup location has to be scheduled before the corresponding delivery location in the route. In order to find near-optimal transportation plans, we discuss a hybrid approach mixing branch-and bound techniques and meta-heuristics. The key idea is that an original problem is decomposed into a set of sub-problems, in which the number of customers assigned to each vehicle is fixed, and respective sub-problem is solved by meta-heuristics such as simulated annealing heuristics. Then, promising sub-problems are able to be found efficiently by using branch-and-bound techniques. The effectiveness and the potential of the proposed approach are evaluated by a series of computational experiments. © 2009 SICE.","Branch-and-bound algorithm; Decomposition; Pickup and delivery problem; Simulated annealing algorithm","Branch and bounds; Branch-and-bound algorithm; Branch-and-bound algorithms; Computational experiment; Decomposition model; Hybrid approach; Meta heuristics; Pickup and delivery; Pickup and delivery problems; Simulated annealing algorithms; Sub-problems; Transportation plans; Vehicle Routing Problems; Algorithms; Annealing; Computational efficiency; Location; Pickups; Simulated annealing",,,,,"Pochet, Y., Wolsey, L.A., (2006) Production Planning by Mixed Integer Programming, , Springer; Savelsbergh, M.W.P., Sol, M., The General Pickup and Delivery Problem (1995) Transportation Science, 29, pp. 17-29; (1985) The Traveling Salesman Problem, , E.

These companies consolidate multiple shipments in vehicles to guarantee the efficiency of the system. A method for LTL carriers is presented to solve the long-haul routing design problem with capacitated distribution centers and time-constrained shipments. The method uses direct, hub-and-spoke, and stopover strategies to allocate shipments in the set of routes. The resolution method is based on a tabu search algorithm. The search process in the solution domain is performed dynamically with four possible perturbations. The results obtained in a set of test problems demonstrate that the restart parameters play a significant role in the efficiency of the algorithm.

Besides the minimum cost objective a client centered objective has been defined. Phase one consists of an iterated variable neighborhood search-based heuristic, generating approximate weighted sum solutions; phase two is a path relinking module, computing additional efficient solutions. Results for two sets of benchmark instances are reported. For the smaller instances, exact efficient sets are generated by means of the ε-constraint method. Comparison shows that the proposed two-phase method is able to generate high-quality approximations of the true Pareto frontier. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Bi-objective optimization; Dial-a-ride problem; Path relinking; Variable neighborhood search","Bi-objective optimization; Constraint methods; Dial-a-ride problem; Efficient sets; High quality; Minimum cost; Multi objective; Pareto frontiers; Path relinking; Phase solutions; Two phase method; Variable neighborhood search; Weighted Sum; Heuristic methods",,,,,"Aiex, R.M., Binato, S., Resende, M.G.C., Parallel GRASP with path relinking for job shop scheduling (2003) Parallel Comput, 29, pp. 393-430; Aiex, R.M., Resende, M.G.C., Pardalos, P.M., Toraldo, G., GRASP with path relinking for the three-index assignment problem (2005) INFORMS J Comput, 17, pp. 224-247; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Gribkovskaia, I., Laporte, G., Static pickup and delivery problems: A classification scheme and survey (2007) TOP, 15, pp. 1-31; Bräysy, O., A reactive variable neighborhood search for the vehicle-routing problem with time windows (2003) INFORMS J Comput, 15, pp. 347-368; Cordeau, J.-F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Oper Res, 54, pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transport Res B-Meth, 37, pp. 579-594; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem: Models and algorithms (2007) Ann Oper Res, 153, pp. 29-46; Cullen, F., Jarvis, J., Ratliff, D., Set partitioning based heuristics for interactive routing (1981) Networks, 11, pp. 125-143; Czyzak, P., Jaszkiewicz, A., A multiobjective metaheuristic approach to the location of petrol stations by the capital budgeting model (1996) Control and Cybernetics, 25 (1), pp. 177-187. , Simulated Annealing Applied to Combinational Optimization; Czyzak, P., Jaszkiewicz, A., Pareto simulated annealing - A metaheuristic technique for multiple-objective combinatorial optimization (1998) J Multi-Crit Dec Anal, 7, pp. 34-47; Deb, K., Pratap, A., Agarwal, S., Meyarivan, T., A fast and elitist multi-objective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II (2002) IEEE T Evol Comput, 6, pp. 182-197; Diana, M., Dessouky, M.M., A new regret insertion heuristic for solving large-scale dial-a-ride problems with time windows (2004) Transport Res B-Meth, 38, pp. 539-557; Doerner, K.F., Gutjahr, W.J., Hartl, R.F., Strauss, C., Stummer, C., Pareto ant colony optimization: A metaheuristic approach to multi-objective portfolio selection (2004) Ann Oper Res, 131, pp. 79-99; Dumas, Y., Desrosiers, J., Soumis, F., Large scale multi- vehicle dial-a-ride problems (1989) Technical Report G-89-130, , HEC, Montréal, Canada; Ehrgott, M., Gandibleux, X., Approximative solution methods for multi-objective combinatorial optimization (2004) TOP, 12, pp. 1-89; Ehrgott, M., Tenfelde-Podehl, D., Computation of ideal and Nadir values and implications for their use in MCDM methods (2003) Eur J Oper Res, 151, pp. 119-139; Gandibleux, X., Mezdaoui, N., Fréville, A., A tabu search procedure to solve multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (1997) Lecture Notes in Economics and Mathematical Systems, MOPGP 1996, 455, pp. 291-300. , R.

The methodology is based on a module simulating incoming bookings, built around a heuristic for solving the underlying dial-a-flight problem.

This problem is to schedule dial-a-ride requests, where some part of each journey may be carried out by a fixed route service. The IDARP is a generalization of the Dial-a-Ride Problem. An arc-based formulation is proposed, and it is shown how the model can be made easier to solve by arc elimination, variable substitution and the introduction of subtour elimination constraints. Small instances of the IDARP can be solved using an exact solution method, and one such instance is studied. We also describe how input and output data can be created and visualized in a geographic information system. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",,"Dial-a-Ride; Dial-a-ride problem; Exact solution; Input and outputs; Variable substitution; Geographic information systems",,,,,"Aldaihani, M., Dessouky, M., Hybrid scheduling methods for paratransit operations (2003) Comput Ind Eng, 45, pp. 75-96; Attanasio, A., Cordeau, J., Ghiani, G., Laporte, G., Parallel tabu search heuristics for the dynamic multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2004) Parallel Comput, 30, pp. 377-387; Baugh, J., Kakivaya, G., Stone, J., Intractability of the dial-a-ride problem and a multiobjective solution using simulated annealing (1998) Eng Optim, 30, pp. 91-123; Bergvinsdottir, K., Larsen, J., Jorgensen, R., (2004) Solving the dial-a-ride problem using genetic algorithms, , Technical Report 2004-20, Informatics and Mathematical Modelling, Technical University of Denmark, Denmark; Börjesson, M., (2001) Erfarenheter av samordning av färdtjänst och sjukresor i Dalsland, , Vinnova Rapport 2001: 27; Borndörfer, R., Grötschel, M., Klostermeier, F., Küttner, C., Telebus Berlin: Vehicle scheduling in a dial-a-ride system (1997), Technical Report SC 97-23, Konrad-Zuse-Zentrum für Informationstechnik, Berlin; Chan, S., (2004) Metaheuristics for solving the dial-a-ride problem, , PhD Thesis, North Carolina State University, USA; Cordeau, J., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Oper Res, 54, pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transp Res Part B, 37, pp. 579-594; Diana, M., Dessouky, M., A new regret insertion heuristic for solving large-scale dial-a-ride problems with time windows (2004) Transp Res Part B, 38, pp. 539-557; Hickman, M., Blume, K., (2001) An investigation of integrated transit service, , Research Report SWUTC/01/472840-00023-1, Texas Transportation Institute, USA; Horn, M., Procedures for planning multi-leg journeys with fixed-route and demand-responsive passenger transport services (2004) Transp Res Part C, 12, pp. 33-55; Ioachim, I., Desrosiers, J., Dumas, Y., Solomon, M., Villeneuve, D., A request clustering algorithm for door-to-door handicapped transportation (1995) Transp Sci, 29, pp. 63-78; Jaw, J., Odoni, A., Psaraftis, H., Wilson, N., A heuristic algorithm for the multi-vehicle advance request dial-a-ride problem with time windows (1986) Transp Res Part B, 20, pp. 243-257; Liaw, C., White, C., Bander, J., A decision support system for the bimodal dial-a-ride problem (1996) IEEE Trans Syst Man Cybern Part A, 26, pp. 552-565; Madsen, O., Ravn, H., Rygaard, J.M., A heuristic algorithm for a dial-a-ride problem with time windows, multiple capacities, and multiple objectives (1995) Ann Oper Res, 60, pp. 193-208; Parragh, S., Doerner, K., Hartl, R., A survey on pickup and delivery problems: Part II: Transportation between pickup and delivery locations (2008) J Betriebswirtsch, 58, pp. 81-117; Psaraftis, H., A dynamic programming solution to the single vehicle many-to-many immediate request dial-a-ride problem (1980) Transp Sci, 14, pp. 130-154; Psaraftis, H., An exact algorithm for the single vehicle many-to-many dial-a-ride problem with time windows (1983) Transp Sci, 17, pp. 351-357; Ropke, S., Cordeau, J., Laporte, G., Models and branch-and-cut algorithms for pickup and delivery problems with time windows (2007) Networks, 49, pp. 258-272; Toth, P., Vigo, D., Heuristic algorithms for the handicapped persons transportation problem (1997) Transp Sci, 31, pp. 60-71; Uchimura, K., Takahashi, H., Saitoh, T., Demand responsive services in hierarchical public transportation system (2002) IEEE Trans Veh Technol, 51, pp. 760-766; Wilson, N., Sussman, J., Wang, H., Higonnet, B., (1971) Scheduling algorithms for dial-a-ride systems, , Technical Report USL-TR-71-13, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA; Wilson, N., Weissberg, R., Hauser, J., (1976) Advanced dial-a-ride algorithms research project: Final report, , Technical Report 76-20, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA","Häll, C.

We call this problem the day-ahead paratransit planning problem. The developed model is a non-standard two-stage integer recourse model. Both stages consist of two consecutive optimization problems: the clustering of requests into routes, and the assignment of these routes to vehicles. To solve this model, a genetic algorithm approach is used.

Depending on the hospital layout, transportation between nursing wards and service units is either provided by ambulances or by trained personnel who accompany patients on foot. In many large German hospitals, the patient transport service is poorly managed and lacks work-flow coordination. This contributes to higher hospital costs (e.g., because a patient is not delivered to the operating room on time) and to patient inconvenience (e.g., because of long waiting times). We designed a computer-based planning system, Opti-TRANS©, that supports all phases of the transportation flow, including travel booking, dispatching transport requests, and monitoring and reporting trips in real time. The methodology, which we developed to solve the underlying optimization problem-a dynamic dial-a-ride problem with hospital-specific constraints, draws on fast heuristic methods to ensure the efficient and timely provision of transports. We illustrate the strong impact of Opti-TRANS on the daily performance of the patient transportation service of a large German hospital. The major benefits of Opti-TRANS include streamlined transportation processes and work flow, significant savings, and improved patient satisfaction. Moreover, it has contributed to increased awareness among hospital staff of the importance of implementing efficient logistics practices. © 2009 INFORMS.","Algorithms; Health care; Heuristic; Integer; Programming; Scheduling vehicles; Transportation; Vehicle routing",,,,,,"Aldaihani, M., Dessouky, M., Hybrid scheduling methods for paratransit operations (2003) Comput.

In order to study quality in such contexts, the paper first provides several definitions of quality in the service sector. Then, some models based on the definitions of quality in marketing will be quickly surveyed, and various measurement scales will be presented. After a brief review of the tools and practices used in the service sector to improve quality, the notion of quality in dial-a-ride services is discussed more in depth. In particular, the dimensions and attributes of various scales of measurement used by researchers in dial-a-ride studies are reviewed. Finally, the impact on quality of various elements, like the size and type of organization and the operational rules used, are discussed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

It is usually used as a mean to provide transport for people who are not able to access a private transportation conveniently, or as a transport policy to encourage share rides and reduce driving. In this study, the authors consider the dynamic problem, which receives real-time requests during the day of operation. In the scheduling of the services, there may exist waiting for vehicles along the route at stops. This paper proposes three waiting strategies, namely, drive first (DF), wait first (WF) and modified dynamic wait (MDW), to allocate this waiting time along the stops by holding the vehicles so as to minimise the cost in accepting future calls. Simulation experiments show that the MDW is superior to DF and WF. © 2009 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","DARP; Degree of dynamism; Dial-a-ride problem; Dynamic; Waiting strategies",,,,,,"(2008) Actions on the Integration of Rural Transport Services, , www.rural-transport.net, available at; Branke, J., Middendorf, M., Noeth, G., Dessouky, M., Waiting strategies for dynamic vehicle routing (2005) Transportation Science, 39, pp. 298-312; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research, Part B, 37, pp. 579-594; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem (DARP): Variants, modeling issues and algorithms', 40R: A Quarterly (2003) Journal of Operations Research, pp. 89-101; Coslovich, L., Pesenti, R., Ukovich, W., A two-phase insertion technique of unexpected customers for a dynamic dial-a-ride problem (2006) European Journal of Operational Research, 175, pp. l605-1615; Diana, M., Dessouky, M.M., A new regret insertion heuristic for solving large-scale dial-a-ride problems with time windows (2004) Transportation Research, Part B, 38, pp. 539-557; Jaw, J., Odoni, A.R., Psarafits, H.N., Wilson, N.H.M., A heuristic algorithm for the multi-vehicle advance request dial-a-ride problem with time windows (1986) Transportation Research, Part B, 20, pp. 243-257; Larsen, A., (2000) The dynamic routing problem, , PhD Dissertation, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens, Lyngby, Denmark; Madsen, O.B.G., Ravn, H.F., Rygaard, J.M., A heuristic algorithm for a dial-a-ride problem with time windows, multiple capacities and multiple objectives (1995) Annals of Operations Research, 60, pp. 193-208; Mitrovic-Minic, S., Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows: A Survey (1998) Technical Report SFU, , CMPT 1998-12; Mitrovic-Minic, S., Laporte, G., Waiting strategies for the dynamic pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2004) Transportation Research, Part B, 38, pp. 635-655; Mitrovic-Minic, S., Krishnamurti, R., Laporte, G., Double-horizon based heuristics for the dynamic pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2004) Transportation Research, Part B, 38, pp. 669-685; Psarafits, H.N., A dynamic programming solution to the single vehicle many-to-many immediate request dial a ride problem (1980) Transportation Science, 14, pp. 131-154; Toth, P., Vigo, D., Heuristic algorithms for the handicapped persons transportation problem (1997) Transportation Science, 31, pp. 60-71; Tseng, J.J., (1992) A study on static dial-a-ride routing problems, , M.S.

Brasil 2241, Valparaíso, Chile","On the Dial-a-Ride with time windows (DARPTW) customer transportation problem, there is a set of requests from customers to be transported from an origin place to a delivery place through a locations network, under several constraints like the time windows. The problem complexity (NP-Hard) forces the use of heuristics on its resolution. In this context, the application of Genetic Algorithms (GA) on DARPTW was not largely considered, with the exception of a few researches. In this work, under a restrictive scenario, a GA model for the problem was developed based on the adaptation of a generic GA model from literature. Our solution applies data pre-processing techniques to reduce the search space to points that are feasible regarding time windows constraints. Tests show competitive results on Cordeau & Laporte benchmark datasets while improving processing times. © 2006-2009 by CCC Publications.","DARPTW; Dial-a-ride; Heuristic; Passenger transportation; Scheduling",,,,,,"Bergvinsdottir, K., The Genetic Algorithm for solving the Dial-a-Ride Problem, Master's thesis (2004) Informatics and Mathematical Modelling, , Technical University of Denmark, DTU; Jorgensen, R.M., Larsen, J., Bergvinsdottir, K.B., Solving the Dial-a-Ride problem using genetic algorithms (2006) J.

The timely arrivals of these vehicles help ensure efficient use of airport resources. This research investigates algorithms for scheduling airport service vehicles. A mixed integer linear program is proposed, minimizing service provider fuel costs and air carrier delays. The formulation of the integer programming problem is modified to aid solution search strategies. A genetic algorithm heuristic borrowed from aircraft arrival scheduling is introduced for finding approximate solutions relatively quickly, in addition to an exact solution method making use of branch and bound techniques specially designed for this problem. The various algorithms are tested using simulations of service provider dispatch problems at Hamburg and Dallas-Fort Worth Airports. Results show that plan based service vehicle scheduling reduces both delay and fuel costs over passive strategies, often 20% or more. The genetic algorithm based heuristic also reduced delay and fuel costs while incurring computational burdens significantly below those of the optimal search strategy.","Airport surface; Decision support tools; Scheduling; Service vehicles; Vehicle routing","Advanced traffic management systems; Air traffic control; Airports; Algorithms; Amphibious vehicles; Branch and bound method; Cost reduction; Costs; Decision support systems; Fighter aircraft; Fuels; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Integer programming; Research and development management; Scheduling algorithms; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Airport surfaces; Approximate solution; Branch and bound techniques; Computational burden; Decision support tools; Integer programming problems; Mixed integer linear program; Optimal search strategy; Scheduling",,,,,"Idris, H., Delcaire, B., Anagnostakis, I., Hall, W.D., Hansman, R.J., Feron, E., Odoni, A., Observations of departure processes at Logan Airport to support the development of departure planning tools (1998) 2nd USA/Europe Air Traffic Management R&D Seminar, , Orlando, USA; Anagnostakis, I., Idris, H.R., Clarke, J.-P., Feron, E., Hansman, R.J., Odoni, A., Hall, W.D., A conceptual design of a departure planner decision aid (2000) 3rd USA/Europe Air Traffic Management R&D Seminar, , Naples, Italy; Carr, F., Theis, G., Clarke, J.-P., Feron, E., Evaluation of improved pushback forecasts derived from airline ground operations data (2005) Journal of Aerospace Computing, Information, and Communication, 12, pp. 25-43; Treude, R., Optimizing performance by monitoring the turnaround process (2005) 5th R& D Symposium, , Braunschweig, Germany; Jaw, J., Odoni, A., Psaraftis, H.N., Wilson, N.H.M., A heuristic algorithm for the multi-vehicle advance request dial-a-ride problem with time windows (1986) Transportation Research Part B, 20, pp. 243-257; Bodin, L.D., Sexton, T., The multi-vehicle subscriber dial-a-ride problem (1986) TIMS Studies in Management Science, 26, pp. 73-86; Cordreau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B, 37, pp. 579-594; Cordreau, J.-F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54, pp. 573-586; Feuerstein, E., Stougie, L., On-line single-server dial-a-ride problems (2001) Theoretical Computer Science, 268, pp. 91-105; Krumke, S.O., De Paepe, W.E., Poensgen, D., Stougie, L., News from the online traveling repairman (2003) Theoretical Computer Science, 295, pp. 279-294; Bonifaci, V., Stougie, L., Online k-server routing problems (2006) 4th Workshop on Approximation and Online Algorithms, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, , Zürich, Switzerland; Jaillet, P., Wagner, M., Online routing problems: Value of advanced information and improved competitive ratios (2006) Transportation Science, 40, pp. 200-210; Ernst, A.T., Krishnamoorthy, M., Storer, R.H., Heuristic and exact algorithms for scheduling aircraft landings (1999) Networks, 34, pp. 229-241",,,"","EUROCONTROL","8th USA/Europe Air Traffic Management Research and Development Seminar, ATM 2009","29 June 2009 through 2 July 2009",,113760,,9781510801714,,,"English","Proc.

The model deals with a static problem and includes several distinct cases such as heterogeneous or homogeneous fleet of vehicles, multi or single depot and a multi-objective function that treats transportation costs and customer inconveniences by using penalties. The simulated annealing application is straightforward with three types of neighbors' moves that are randomly selected and equally distributed. The routes are clustered and scheduled in a separate way using specific heuristic methods.

It is also referred to as a dial-a-ride problem, and it can be classified as a multi-depot pickup and delivery problem with time windows and side constraints. The column generation approach constitutes one of the effective methodologies to solve this problem. However, in order to cope with the complexity of the problem, it is commonly applied in two consecutive stages: clustering and routing. First, clusters of customers are formed who will receive service together; next, vehicle routing decisions are made subject to the clustering decisions. This paper develops a nested column generation method, which integrates clustering and routing decisions, thus extending the applicability of the column generation approach in the context of the subject problem. The proposed method is implemented and applied to solve a problem faced by the transit authority of a mid size US city. A detailed account of implementation experience is provided. The computational results, based on actual data, indicate that problem instances with up to 680 requests and 48 vehicles can be solved within 2% of optimality under mild assumptions, and a 12% performance improvement over a well-established manual planning system can be achieved.","Column generation; Dial-a-ride; Mathematical decomposition; Paratransit; Pickup and delivery problem with time windows; Vehicle routing","Fleet operations; Linear programming; Pickups; Scheduling; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Column generation; Dial-a-Ride; Mathematical decomposition; Paratransit; Pickup and delivery problem with time windows; Problem solving; cluster analysis; decomposition analysis; methodology; planning system; transportation system",,,,,"Astfalk, G., Lustig, I., Marsten, R., Shanno, D., The interior-point method for linear programming (1992) IEEE Software, 9 (4), pp. 61-68; Barnhart, C., Johnson, E.L., Nemhauser, G.L., Savelsbergh, M.W.P., Vance, P.H., Branch-and-price: column generation for solving huge integer programs (1998) Operations Research, 46 (3), pp. 316-329; Bazaraa, M.S., Jarvis, J.J., Sherali, H.D., (2004) Linear Programming and Network Flows. third ed., , John Wiley & Sons, Hoboken, New Jersey; Bodin, L., Golden, B., Assad, A., Ball, M., The routing and scheduling of vehicles and crews - the state of the art (1983) Computers and Operations Research, 10 (2), pp. 62-212; Borndorfer, R., Grotschel, M., Klostermeier, F., Kuttner, C., Telebus Berlin: vehicle scheduling in a dial-a-ride system (1999) Computer-Aided Transit Scheduling.

The mathematical model of the VAP is formulated in terms of multiobjective, combinatorial optimization. It has a strategic, long-term character and takes into account four criteria that represent interests of both passengers and the company's management. The decision consists in the definition of weekly operating frequency (number of rides per week) of buses on international routes between Polish and Western European cities. The VAP is solved in a step-wise procedure. In the first step a sample of efficient (Pareto-optimal) solutions is generated using an original metaheuristic method called Pareto Memetic Algorithm (PMA). In the second step this sample is reviewed and evaluated by the Decision Maker (DM). In this phase an interactive, multiple criteria analysis method with graphical facilities, called Light Beam Search (LBS), is applied. The method helps the DM to define his/her preferences, direct the search process and select the most satisfactory solution.","Metaheuristics; Multiobjective mathematical programming; Multiple criteria analysis; Transportation; Vehicle assignment problem","Bus transportation; Buses; Combinatorial optimization; Decision making; Mathematical programming; Optimization; Pareto principle; Transportation; Vehicles; Meta heuristics; Meta-heuristic methods; Multi-objective mathematical programming; Multiple criteria analysis; Multiple criteria optimization; Passenger transportation; Satisfactory solutions; Vehicle assignment problem; Fleet operations",,,,,"Abara, J., Applying Integer Linear Programming to the Fleet Assignment Problem (1989) Interfaces, 19, pp. 20-28; Armstrong, R.D., Jin, Z., On Solving a Variation of the Assignment Problem (1995) European Journal of Operational Research, 87 (1), pp. 142-147; Balicki, J., Kitowski, Z., Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms with Tabu Search for Task Assignment (2003) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, , Proceedings of First International Conference on Evolutionary Mutli-Criterion Optimization, Springer, Verlag, Berlin; Beaujon, G.J., Turnquist, M.A., A Model for Fleet Sizing and Vehicle Allocation (1991) Transportation Science, 25 (1), pp. 19-45; Benders, J.F., Partitioning Procedures for Solving Mixed Variables Programming Problems (1962) Numerische Math, 4, pp. 238-252; Booler, J.M., The Solution of Railway Locomotive Scheduling Problem (1980) Journal of Operations Research Society, 31, pp. 943-948; Bradley, S.P., Hex, A., Magnanti, T., (1977) Applied Mathematical Programming, , Addison-Wesley, Reading; Cardeau, J., Laporte, G., A Tabu Search Heuristic for the Static Multi-Vehicle Dial-a-Ride Problem (2003) Transportation Research, 37 b (6), pp. 579-594; Coello Coello, C.A., Van Veldhuizen, D.A., Lamon, G.B., (2002) Evolutionary Algorithms for Solving Multi-Objective Problems, , Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht; Cooke, W.P., (1985) Quantitative Methods for Management Decision, , McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York; Crainic, T.G., Service Network Design in Freight Transportation (2000) European Journal of Operational Research, 122, pp. 272-288; Crainic, T.G., Laporte, G., Planning models for freight transportation (1997) European Journal of Operational Research, 97, pp. 409-439; Czyzak, P., Zak, J., A Model of an Urban Transportation System Formulated as Multiobjective Mathematical Programming Problem under Uncertainty (1995) Journal of Advenced Transportation, 29 (1), pp. 43-62; Equi, L., Gallo, G., Marziale, S., Weintraub, A., A Combined Transportation and Scheduling Problem (1997) European Journal of Operational Research, 97 (1), pp. 94-104; Florian, M., Bushell, G., Ferland, J., Guérin, G., Nastansky, L., The Engine Scheduling Problem in a Railway Network (1976) INFOR, 14, pp. 121-138; Forbes, M.A., Holt, J.N., Watts, A.M., Exact solution of locomotive scheduling problem (1991) Journal of Operations Research Society, 42, pp. 825-831; Geetha, S., Nair, K.P.K., A Variation of The Assignment Problem (1993) European Journal of Operational Research, 68, pp. 422-426; Ghoseri, K., Szidarovszky, F., Asgharpour, M., A Multi - Objective Train Scheduling Model and Solution (2004) Transportation Research, 38 B (10), pp. 927-952; Glover, F., Kochenberger, G., (2003) Handbook of Metaheuristics, , Kliwer Academic Publishers, Boston; Goldfarb, D., Efficient Dual Simplex Methods for the Assignment Problem (1985) Mathematical Programming, 33, pp. 187-203; Green, L.V., Guha, D., On the Efficiency of Imbalance in MultiFacility Multi-Server Service Systems (1995) Management Science, 41, pp. 179-187; Hapke, M., Jaszkiewicz, A., Slowinski, R., Fuzzy Project Scheduling System for Software Development (1994) Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 67, pp. 101-117; Hapke, M., Jaszkiewicz, A., Zak, J., 2002.

A main planning system in Sweden uses pre-calculated distance matrices, based on aggregated geographical zones. A trip between two zones is thereby assumed to take a certain time independent of where in the zones the actual pick-up and drop-off points are located. The aim of this paper is to examine the effects of using address-based shortest path calculations instead of zone-based distance estimates. A simulation environment is implemented in C#.Net, based on a standard formulation of the dynamic dial-a-ride problem, and simulations have been performed on historical data from the city of Göteborg. To evaluate the solutions, it is not adequate to evaluate only the objective function value, since a lower estimation of the distances will likely give a lower objective function value. Therefore we also discuss how to evaluate different solutions in other terms than objective function values.",,"Dial-a-ride problem; Distance estimation; Distance matrices; Geographical zones; Objective function values; Planning systems; Simulation environment; Time independents; Estimation; Management science; Function evaluation",,,,,"Attanasio, A., Cordeau, J., Ghiani, G., Laporte, G., Parallel tabu search heuristics for the dynamic multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2004) Parallel Computing, 30, pp. 377-387; Borndörfer, R., Grötschel, M., Klostermeier, F., Küttner, C., Telebus berlin: Vehicle scheduling in a dial-a-ride system (1997) Technical Report SC 97-23, Konrad-Zuse- Zentrum Für Informationstechnik, , Berlin; Colorni, A., Righini, G., Modeling and optimizing dynamic dial-a-ride problems (2001) International Transactions in Operational Research, 8, pp. 155-166; Cordeau, J., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54, pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem (DARP): Variants, modeling issues and algorithms (2003) 4OR - A Quarterly Journal of the Belgian, French and Italian Operations Research Societies, 1, pp. 89-101; Cordeau, J., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi vehicle dial-aride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B, 37, pp. 579-594; Cordeau, J., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem: Models and algorithms (2007) Annals of Operations Research, 153, pp. 29-46; Cordeau, J., Laporte, G., Potvin, J., Savelsbergh, M., Transportation on demand (2004) Technical Report CRT-2004-25, Centre for Research on Transportation; Dessouky, M., Adam, S., Real-time scheduling rules for demand responsive transit systems (1998) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics, pp. 2956-2961; Erkut, E., Bozkaya, B., Analysis of aggregation errors for the p-median problem (1999) Computers and Operations Research, 26, pp. 1075-1096; Fu, L., Scheduling dial-a-ride paratransit under time-varying, stochastic congestion (2002) Transportation Research Part B, 36, pp. 485-506; Fu, L., Teply, S., On-line and off-line routing and scheduling of dial-a-ride paratransit vehicles (1999) Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering, 14, pp. 309-319; Hunsaker, B., Savelsbergh, M., Efficient feasibility testing for dial-a-ride problems (2002) Operations Research Letters, 30, pp. 169-173; Ioachim, I., Desrosiers, J., Dumas, Y., Solomon, M., Villeneuve, D., A request clustering algorithm for door-to-door handicapped transportation (1995) Transportation Science, 29, pp. 63-78; Jaw, J., Odoni, A., Psaraftis, H., Wilson, N., A heuristic algorithm for the multivehicle advance request dial-a-ride problem with time windows (1986) Transportation Research Part B, 20, pp. 243-257; Madsen, O., Ravn, H., Rygaard, J.M., A heuristic algorithm for a dial-a-ride problem with time windows, multiple capacities, and multiple objectives (1995) Annals of Operations Research, 60, pp. 193-208; Psaraftis, H., An exact algorithm for the single vehicle many-to-many dial-a-ride problem with time windows (1983) Transportation Science, 17, pp. 351-357; Teodorovich, D., Radivojevic, G., A fuzzy logic approach to dynamic dial-a-ride problem (2000) Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 116, pp. 23-33; Toth, P., Vigo, D., Heuristic algorithms for the handicapped persons transportation problem (1997) Transportation Science, 31, pp. 60-71","Department of Science and Technology, Linköping University, SE-60174 Norrköping, Sweden",,,,"13th International Conference of Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies: Transportation and Management Science","13 December 2008 through 15 December 2008","Kowloon",102956,,9789889884734,,,"English","Proc.

A multi-objective nonlinear mixed integer model is formulated. Solution methodologies are proposed, which consist of three main components: an initial candidate route set generation procedure (ICRSGP) that generates all feasible routes incorporating practical bus transit industry guidelines; a network analysis procedure (NAP) that decides transit demand matrix, assigns transit trips, determines service frequencies, and computes performance measures; and a Tabu search method (TSM) that combines these two parts, guides the candidate solution generation process, and selects an optimal set of routes from the huge solution space. Comprehensive tests are conducted and sensitivity analyses are performed. Characteristics analyses are undertaken and solution qualities from different algorithms are compared. Numerical results clearly indicate that the preferred TSM outperforms the genetic algorithm used as a benchmark for the optimal bus transit route network design problem without zone demand aggregation. © 2008 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering.",,"Agglomeration; Benchmarking; Buses; Electric network analysis; Genetic algorithms; Graph theory; Heuristic methods; Heuristic programming; Mass transportation; Routing algorithms; Sensitivity analysis; Set theory; Transportation; Transportation routes; Candidate solution; Comprehensive testing; Generation process; Industry guidelines; Mixed integers; Multi objectives; Network analysis; Numerica l results; Performance measures; Public transportation networks; Public transportations; Search strategies; Solution spaces; Tabu Search (TS); Tabu search methods; Transit demand; Transit route network; Variable demand; Tabu search; bus transport; network analysis; network design; numerical model; optimization; public transport; sensitivity analysis; travel demand",,,,,"Ahuja, R.K., Magnanti, T.L., Orlin, J.B., (1993) Network Flows: Theory, Algorithms and Applications, , Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ; Baaj, M.H., Mahmassani, H.S., (1990) TRUST: A Lisp Program for the Analysis of Transit Route Configuration, Transportation Research Record 1283, pp. 125-135. , Transportation Research Board, Washington, DC; Baaj, M.H., Mahmassani, H.S., An AI-based approach for transit route system planning and design (1991) Journal of Advanced Transportation, 25 (2), pp. 187-210; Baaj, M.H., Mahmassani, H.S., (1992) Artificial Intelligence-Based System Representation and Search Procedures for Transit Route Network Design, Transportation Research Record 1358, pp. 67-70. , Transportation Research Board, Washington, DC; Ben-Akiva, M., Lerman, S., (1985) Discrete Choice Analysis: Theory and Application to Travel Demand, , MIT Press Cambridge, MA; Ceder, A., Wilson, N.H., Bus network design (1986) Transportation Research, 20 B (4), pp. 331-344; Ceder, A., Israeli, Y., User and operator perspective in transit network design (1998), Paper No. 980267, The 77th Annual Meeting of TRB, Washington, DC; Ceder, A., Gonzalez, O., Gonzalez, H., (2002) Design of Bus Routes: Methodology and the Santo Domingo Case, Transportation Research Record No. 1791, , Transportation Research Board, Washington, DC; Cevallos, F., Zhao, F., (2006) Minimizing Transfer Times in Public Transit Network With Genetic Algorithm, Transportation Research Record No. 1971, pp. 74-79. , Transportation Research Board, Washington, DC; Chakroborty, P., Dwivedi, T., Optimal route network design for transit systems using genetic algorithms (2002) Engineering Optimization, 34 (1), pp. 83-100; Chien, S., Yang, Z., Hou, E., A genetic algorithm approach for transit route planning and design (2001) Journal of Transportation Engineering, ASCE, 127 (3), pp. 200-207; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research.

Basically, two problem classes can be distinguished. The first part dealt with the transportation of goods from the depot to linehaul customers and from backhaul customers to the depot. The second part now considers all those problems where goods are transported between pickup and delivery locations, denoted as Vehicle Routing Problems with Pickups and Deliveries (VRPPD). These are the Pickup and Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem (PDVRP - unpaired pickup and delivery points), the classical Pickup and Delivery Problem (PDP - paired pickup and delivery points), and the Dial-A-Ride Problem (DARP - passenger transportation between paired pickup and delivery points and user inconvenience taken into consideration). Single as well as multi vehicle mathematical problem formulations for all three VRPPD types are given, and the respective exact, heuristic, and metaheuristic solution methods are discussed. © Wirtschaftsuniversität Wien, Austria 2008.","Dial-a-ride problem; Pick up and delivery problem; Pickup and delivery vehicle routing; Survey; Transportation",,,,,,"Aldaihani, M., Dessouky, M.M., Hybrid scheduling methods for paratransit operations (2003) Comput Ind Eng, 45, pp. 75-96; Alfa, A.S., Scheduling of vehicles for transportation of elderly (1986) Transport Plan Tech, 11, pp. 203-212; Ambrosini, M., Caruso, T., Foresti, S., Righini, G., (2004) A GRASP for the Pickup and Delivery Problem With Rear Loading, , Tech.

The Improving initial Task Assignment and Avoiding Deadlock method (ITAAD) is a faster algorithm than the triple loop method. In this paper, we propose a new vehicle routing method for the ITAAD.

Mobility Allowance Shuttle Transit is a transportation concept that merges the flexibility of Demand Responsive Transit systems with the low cost operability of fixed-route bus systems. In this paper, we study the service capacity design problem for such a system. We analyze the relationship between service cycle time, and the length and width of the service area under a desired service level constraint. The analysis can be used as a guide for designing service area parameters. Given that a shuttle travels in a rectilinear pattern and utilizes a non-backtracking nearest-insertion algorithm, we derive closed-form approximate solutions for the service capacity design problem. We show that setting the length of the service area to half the travel speed of the shuttle multiplied by the cycle time is an effective approximation. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Each request originates at one location and is destined for one other location. These requests apply to the transportation of goods or people, in which case the problem is often called the dial-a-ride problem. In recent years, there have been several significant developments in the area of exact and heuristic algorithms for PDPs. The purpose of this chapter is to report on these developments. It contains two main sections devoted to single vehicle and multi-vehicle problems, respectively. Each section is subdivided into two parts, one on exact algorithms and one on heuristics. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008.","Branch-and-cut; Column generation; Dial-a-ride; One-to-one; Pickup and delivery; Tabu search",,,,,,"Balas, E., Fischetti, M., Pulleyblank, W.R., The precedenceconstrained asymmetric traveling salesman polytope (1995) Mathematical Programming, 68, pp. 241-265; Bent, R., Van Hentenryck, P., A two-stage hybrid algorithm for pickup and delivery vehicle routing problems with time windows (2006) Computers & Operations Research, 33, pp. 875-893; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Gribkovskaia, I., Laporte, G., Static pickup and delivery problems: A classification scheme and survey (2007) TOP, 15, pp. 1-31; Bianco, L., Mingozzi, A., Ricciardelli, S., Exact and heuristic procedures for the traveling salesman problem with precedence constraints, based on dynamic programming (1994) INFOR, 32, pp. 19-31; Bodin, L.D., Sexton, T., The multi-vehicle subscriber dial-a-ride problem (1986) TIMS Studies in Management Science, 26, pp. 73-86; Borndörfer, R., Grötschel, M., Klostermeier, F., Küttner, C., (1997) Telebus Berlin: Vehicle scheduling in a dial-a-ride system., , Technical Report SC 97-23, Konrad-Zuse-Zentrum für Informationstechnik Berlin; Brønmo, G., Christiansen, M., Fagerholt, K., Nygreen, B., A multistart local search heuristic for ship scheduling-a computational study (2007) Computers & Operations Research, 34, pp. 900-917; Carrabs, F., (2006) Heuristics and exact approaches for transportation problems with pickup and delivery., , Ph.

The problem requires that any paired pickup and delivery locations have to be served by one vehicle and the pickup location has to be scheduled before the corresponding delivery location in the route. In this paper, to search a set of routes close to the optimal one, we propose autonomous distributed approaches based on the search space decomposition for the problem. In this approach, first, the search space is divided into sub-spaces based on the number of customers loaded on each vehicle. Then, the genetic algorithm is applied to these sub-spaces. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated by computational experiments. © 2007 SICE.","Decomposition; Genetic algorithms; Pickup and delivery problem with time windows","Genetic algorithms; Vehicles; Windows; Annual conference; Computational experiments; Control engineers; Decomposition; Distributed approaches; Pick up and delivery; Pickup and delivery problem with time windows; Pickup and delivery problems with time windows; Practical transportation; Search spaces; Sub-spaces; Location",,,,,"Dumas, Y., Desrosiers, J., Soumis, The Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (1991) European J. of Operational Research, 54, pp. 7-21; Savelsbergh, M.W.P., Sol, M., The General Pickup and Delivery Problem (1995) Transportation Science, 29, pp. 17-29; Nanry, W.P., Barnes, J.W., Solving the General Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows Using Reactive Tabu Search (2000) Transportation Research Part B, 34, pp. 107-121; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B, 37, pp. 579-594; Van Der Bruggen, L.J.J., Lenstra, J.K., Schuur, P.C., Variable-Depth Search for the Single-Vehicle Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (1993) Transportation Science, 27, pp. 298-311; Li, H., Lim, A., A metaheuristic for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2003) International Journal on Artificial Intelligence Tools, 12 (2), pp. 173-186; Sakakibara, K., Noishiki, M., Watanabe, S., Tamaki, H., Nishikawa, I., Hierarchical Approach with Informational Feedback for Pickup and Delivery Problems (2006) Proceedings of International Symposium on Scheduling 2006, pp. 48-53; Back, T., Fogel, D.B., Michalewicz, Z., (2000) Evolutionary Computation (2), , Institute of Physics Publishing, Bristol; Davis, L., Applying Adaptive Algorithms to Epistatic Domains (1985) Proc. of 9th Int.

The TARP results in a constrained version of die Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows(PDPTW). As an approach to this problem, a cooperative algorithm with autonomous distributed agents has been proposed. The algorithm is able to plan deadlock-free routes even though the buffer capacity is small, but includes reformability at the point that computation time of that case increases drastically. We have proposed an initial task assignment method to reduce computational time on planning routes. This paper evaluates the proposed method, and results of evaluation show effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2007 SICE.","Autonomous distributed systems; Intelligent manufacturing systems; Multi agent; PDPTW; Vehicle routing","Autonomous agents; Manufacture; Annual conference; Autonomous distributed systems; Buffer capacities; Computation time; Computational time; Control engineers; Cooperative algorithms; Distributed agents; Intelligent manufacturing systems; Manufacturing systems; Multi agent; PDPTW; Pickup and delivery problem with time windows; Routing problems; Task assignments; Transportation systems; Vehicle routing; Routing algorithms",,,,,"http://www.ims.org, IMS Center; Chan, F.T.S., Chan, H.K., A comprehensive survey and future trend of simulation study on FMS scheduling (2004) Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, 15 (1), pp. 87-102; Vis, I.F.A., Survey of research in the design and control of automated guided vehicle systems (2006) European Journal of Operational Research, 170 (3), pp. 677-709; Baker, A.D., A survey of factory control algorithms that can be implemented in a multi-agent heterarchy: Dispatching, scheduling, and pull (1998) Journal of Manufacturing Systems, 17 (4), pp. 297-320; Giret, A., Botti, V., Holons and agents (2004) Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, 15, pp. 645-659; Bordin, L.D., Assad, A., Ball, M., Routing and scheduling of vehicles and crews: The state of the art (1983) Computers & Operations Research, 10 (2), pp. 63-67; Psaraftis, H., An Exact Algorithm for the Single Vehicle Many-to-Many Dial-A-Ride Problem with Time Windows (1983) Transportation Science, 17 (3), pp. 351-357; Desrosiers, J., Dumas, Y., Soumis, F., A Dynamic Programming Solution of the Large-Scale Single-Vehicle Dial-a-Ride Problem with Time Windows (1986) American Journal of Mathematical and Management Sciences, 6 (3), pp. 301-325; Ruland, K., Rodyn, E., The Pickup and Delivery Problem: Faces and Branch-and-Cut Algorithm (1997) Computers Math.

We focus, in particular, on problems where the uncertainty comes from the occurrence of new requests. Problem-solving approaches are investigated in contexts where consolidation of multiple requests onto the same vehicle is allowed and addressed through the design of planned routes. Starting with pure myopic approaches, we then review in later sections the issues of diversion and anticipation of future requests. © 2007 by Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Anticipation; Diversion; Planned routes; Real-time; Vehicle routing",,,,,,"Angelelli, E., Mansini, R., Speranza, M.G., A real-time vehicle routing model for a courier service problem (2004) Distribution Logistics: Advanced Solutions to Practical Problems, pp. 87-104. , in, Lecture Notes in Economics and Mathematical Systems 544, B.

Therefore a holistic approach to the design and evaluation of City Logistics applications requires an integrated framework in which all components could work together that is must be modelled not only in terms of the core models for vehicle routing and fleet management, but also in terms of models able of including the dynamic aspects of traffic on the underlying road network, namely if Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) applications are taken into account. This paper reports on the modelling framework developed in the national projects SADERYL-I and II, sponsored by the Spanish ""Dirección General de Ciencia y Tecnología"" (DGCYT) and tested in the European Project MEROPE of the INTERREG IIIB Programme. The modelling framework consists of a Decision Support System whose core architecture is composed by a Data Base, to store all the data required by the implied models: location of logistic centres and customers, capacities of warehouses and depots, transportation costs, operational costs, fleet data, etc.; a Database Management System, for the updating of the information stored in the data base; a Model Base, containing the family of models and algorithms to solve the related problems, discrete location, network location, street vehicle routing and scheduling; a Model Base Management System, to update, modify, add or delete models from the Model Base; a GIS based Graphic User Interface supporting the dialogues to define and update data, select the model suitable to the intended problem, generate automatically from the digital map of the road network the input graph for the Network Location and Vehicle Routing models, apply the corresponding algorithm, visualize the problem and the results, etc. To account for the dynamics of urban traffic flows the system includes an underlying dynamic traffic simulation model (AIMSUN in this case) which is able to track individually the fleet vehicles, emulating in this way the monitoring of fleet vehicles in a real time fleet management system, gathering dynamic data (i.e. current position, previous position, current speed, previous speed, etc.) while following the vehicle, in a similar way as the data that in real life an equipped vehicle could provide. This is the information required by a ""Dynamic Router and Scheduler"" to determine which vehicle will be assigned to the new service and which will be the new route for the selected vehicle. © 2007 by Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","City Logistics; Dynamic traffic simulation; Vehicle Routing",,,,,,"Baldacci, R., Mingozzi, A., Hadjiconstantinou, E., An exact algorithm for the capacitated vehicle routing problem based on a two-commodity network flow formulation (2004) Operations Research, 52 (5), pp. 723-738; Barcelo, J., An overview of models to assist in the design and evaluation of City Logistics projects (2006) Systems and Advanced Solutions for City Logistics, , 2006, in, Eds.

A request consists of a specified pickup location and destination location along with a desired departure or arrival time and capacity demand. The aim of DARP is to minimize transportation cost while satisfying customer service level constraints (Quality of Service). In this paper, we present a genetic algorithm (GA) for solving the DARP. The algorithm is based on the classical cluster-first, route-second approach, where it alternates between assigning customers to vehicles using a GA and solving independent routing problems for the vehicles using a routing heuristic. The algorithm is implemented in Java and tested on publicly available data sets. The new solution method has achieved solutions comparable with the current state-of-the-art methods. © 2007 Operational Research Society Ltd.

In addition to capacity and time window constraints, vehicle routes must also satisfy pairing and precedence constraints on pickups and deliveries. This paper introduces two new formulations for the PDPTW and the closely related dial-a-ride problem (DARP) in which a limit is imposed on the elapsed time between the pickup and the delivery of a request. Several families of valid inequalities are introduced to strengthen these two formulations. These inequalities are used within branch-and-cut algorithms which have been tested on several instance sets for both the PDPTW and the DARP. Instances with up to eight vehicles and 96 requests (194 nodes) have been solved to optimality. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Branch-and-cut; Pickup and delivery; Time windows; Valid inequalities","Constraint theory; Mathematical models; Network management; Problem solving; Time windows; Valid inequalities; Routing algorithms",,,,,"Ascheuer, N., Fischetti, M., Grötschel, M., A polyhedral study of the asymmetric traveling salesman problem with time windows (2000) Networks, 36, pp. 69-79; Ascheuer, N., Fischetti, M., Grötschel, M., Solving the asymmetric travelling salesman problem with time windows by branch-and-cut (2001) Math Program, 90, pp. 475-506; Ascheuer, N., Jünger, M., Reinelt, G., A branch & cut algorithm for the asymmetric traveling salesman problem with precedence constraints (2000) Comput Optim Appl, 17, pp. 61-84; Augerat, P., Belenguer, J.M., Benavent, E., Corberán, A., Naddef, D., Separating capacity inequalities in the CVRP using tabu search (1999) Eur J Operational Res, 106, pp. 546-557; Balas, E., Fischetti, M., Pulleyblank, W.R., The precedence-constrained asymmetric traveling salesman polytope (1995) Math Program, 68, pp. 241-265; Cordeau, J.-F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Res, 54, pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transport Res B, 37, pp. 579-594; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Potvin, J.-Y., Savelsbergh, M.W.P., Transportation on demand (2007) Transportation, Handbooks in Operations Research and Management Science, pp. 429-466. , C.

A large number of initial solutions are generated by an insertion heuristic with random elements. The best initial solutions are improved by a local search heuristic that is split into a quick and an extended version. The quick local search is used to improve a given number of the best initial solutions. The extended local search heuristic is then used to further improve some of the best solutions found. The multi-start local search heuristic is compared with an optimization-based solution approach with respect to computation time and solution quality. The computational study shows that the multi-start local search method consistently returns optimal or near-optimal solutions to real-life instances of the ship scheduling problem within a reasonable amount of computation time. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The TARP results in a constrained version of the Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (PDPTW). As an approach to this problem, a cooperative algorithm with autonomous distributed agents has been proposed. The algorithm is able to plan deadlockfree routes even though the buffer capacity is less, but includes reformability at the point that computation time of that case increases drastically. This paper proposes an initial task assignment method to reduce computation time on planning routes.

It can be modeled as an NP-hard routing and scheduling problem, with a suitable mixed integer programming formulation. Exact approaches to this problem are too limited to tackle real-life instances (hundred of trips), therefore heuristics are needed. The heuristic method proposed in this paper builds an auxiliary graph and then solves an assignment problem on this graph. The auxiliary graph is obtained by replacing pairs of nodes with a single one and associating an ad hoc cost function to the new set of arcs. Two different simple methods are employed to transform the infeasible solution given by the assignment problem into a feasible one. The proposed algorithms have been tested on instances created using the Milan network and shown to be fast and effective. © Springer Verlag 2007.","Dial-a-Ride; Heuristic; Routing; Scheduling",,,,,,"Amaldi, E., Colorni, A., Fiorenzo Catalano, S., Feasibility study of a dial-a-ride system for a suburban area of milan (2000) Ric Oper, 30 (94-95), pp. 5-28; Carraghan, R., Pardalos, P.M., An exact algorithm for the maximum clique problem (1990) Oper Res Lett, 9, pp. 375-382; Cordeau, J.-F., A branch and cut algorithm for a dial-a-ride problem (2003) Oper Res, , in press; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, O., The dial-a-ride problem (darp): Variants, modeling issues and algorithms. 4OR (2003), 1, pp. 89-101; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristics for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transp Res B, 37, pp. 579-594; Cordone, R., Wolfler Calvo, R., Note about time window constraints in routing problems (1996), Internal report 96-005.

The logistics planning involves dispatching commodities to distribution centers in the affected areas and evacuating the wounded people to medical centers. The proposed method decomposes the original emergency logistics problem into two phases of decision making, i.e., the vehicle route construction, and the multi-commodity dispatch. The sub-problems are solved in an iterative manner. The first phase builds stochastic vehicle paths under the guidance of pheromone trails while a network flow based solver is developed in the second phase for the assignment between different types of vehicle flows and commodities. The performance of the algorithm is tested on a number of randomly generated networks and the results indicate that this algorithm performs well in terms of solution quality and run time. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Martin Hall, College Park, MD 20742, United States","We present here a new heuristic for the static multi-vehicle Dial-A-Ride Problem, which we call a rejected-reinsertion heuristic. Its main objective is to minimize the number of vehicles used to satisfy all the demand, subject to service quality constraints. Passenger deviation from desired time is minimized in the scheduling stage after the insertion position is determined. This method improves the basic parallel insertion heuristic in two aspects. First, a rejected-reinsertion operation is performed each time it is infeasible to insert a new request into the vehicle routes. Each assigned request close to the new request in time frame and geographic location is tentatively removed from its current vehicle and the new request is inserted into the best position in that vehicle route, followed by the reinsertion of the removed request elsewhere in the system. Of all available rejected-reinsertions, the least-cost one is then implemented. Second, an improvement procedure including trip reinsertion and trip exchange operations is implemented periodically. Two sets of problems are tested in a computational study. These show that the proposed heuristic achieves vehicle reductions of up to 17% over the parallel insertion heuristic and is very efficient computationally. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, to search a set of routes close to the optimal one, we propose the autonomous distributed genetic approach based on the search space decomposition for the problem. In this approach, first, the search space is divided into sub-spaces based on the number of customers loaded in each vehicle. Then, GA is applied in each sub-space. In addition, the dynamic separation is applied for an efficient search.

This problem is a complicated one in which multiple kinds of decisions are included. The problem requires that any paired pickup and delivery locations have to be served by one vehicle and the pickup location has to be scheduled before the corresponding delivery location in the route. In order to find near-optimal routing plans, we discuss a distributed meta-heuristic approach. The key idea is that the problem is decomposed into a set of partial problems, in which the number of customers assigned to each vehicle is fixed, and each partial problem is solved by meta-heuristics such as simulated annealing heuristics. Then, we propose a parallel search method to find promising partial problems effectively.

The TARP results in a constrained version of the Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows(PDPTW). As an approach to this problem, a cooperative algorithm with autonomous distributed agents has been proposed. The algorithm is able to plan deadlock-free routes even though the buffer capacity is less, but includes reformability at the point that computation time of that case increases drastically. This paper proposes an initial task assignment method to reduce computation time on planning routes.

In this heuristic, a properly organized local search strategy and a diversification strategy are used to improve initial solutions. Then the improved solutions can be refined further by an intensification strategy. The performance of this heuristic was evaluated by intensive computational tests on some randomly generated instances. Small gaps to the lower bounds from the column generation method were obtained in very short time for instances with no more than 200 requests. Although the result is not sensitive to the initial solution, the computational time can be greatly reduced if some effort is spent to construct a good initial solution. With this good initial solution, larger instances up to 2000 requests were solved in less than 10 hours on a popular personal computer. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In these problems, vehicles have to transport (clients, loads, etc.,) from their locations to different destinations (hospitals, shop centres, etc.). The objective of this paper is to implement Grouping Genetic Algorithm to find optimal (or close to optimal) routes for transporting handicapped people in terms of service quality and number of used vehicles. This algorithm is a stochastic search method based on randomized operators for combining solutions and producing better ones. The proposed algorithm has been applied on the handicapped persons transportation problem in the city of Brussels, Belgium.

Transportation is carried out by vehicles providing a shared service. The problem consists of designing a set of minimum-cost vehicle routes satisfying capacity, duration, time window, pairing, precedence, and ride-time constraints. This paper introduces a mixed-integer programming formulation of the problem and a branch-and-cut algorithm. The algorithm uses new valid inequalities for the dial-a-ride problem as well as known valid inequalities for the traveling salesman, the vehicle routing, and the pick-up and delivery problems. Computational experiments performed on randomly generated instances show that the proposed approach can be used to solve small to medium-size instances. ©2006 INFORMS.","Cutting plane; Programming; Transportation; Vehicle routing","Algorithms; Computational geometry; Computational methods; Constraint theory; Problem solving; Transportation; Traveling salesman problem; Cutting plane; Dial-a-ride problem; Programming; Vehicle routing; Operations research",,,,,"Ascheuer, N., (1996) Hamiltonian Path Problems in the On-line Optimization of Flexible Manufacturing Systems, , Ph.D. thesis, Konrad-Zuse-Zentrum für Informationstechnik Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Ascheuer, N., Fischetti, M., Grötschel, M., Solving the asymmetric travelling salesman problem with time windows by branch-and-cut (2001) Math.

Vehicles of a given fleet with limited capacity depart from and end at a common depot. The travel time of passengers cannot exceed a given multiple of the minimum ride time. Other constraints include vehicle capacity and vehicle route duration. In practice, scheduling is made more complicated by special user requirements and an inhomogeneous vehicle fleet. The transportation of elderly and handicapped people is an important example, as space for wheelchairs is limited and a lift is required. In this study, we present a modified insertion heuristic to solve the DARP with multi-dimensional capacity constraints, and the performance of the proposed algorithm is tested in simulation. We show that the proposed methodology is effective when compared with the classic algorithms. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Capacity constraints; Dial-a-ride; Elderly transportation",,,,,,"Attanasio, A., Cordeau, J.F., Ghiani, G., Laporte, G., Parallel tabu search heuristics for the dynamic multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2004) Parallel Computing, 30, pp. 377-387; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research, 37 B, pp. 579-594; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The Dial-a-Ride Problem: Variants, modeling issues and algorithms (2003) 4OR- Quarterly Journal of the Belgian, French and Italian Operations Research Societies, 1, pp. 89-101; Diana, M., Dessouky, M.M., A new regret insertion heuristic for solving large-scale dial-a-ride problems with time windows (2004) Transportation Research, 38 B, pp. 539-557; Fabri, A., Recht, P., On dynamic pickup and delivery vehicle routing with several time windows and waiting times (2005) Transportation Research B; Ioachim, I., Desrosiers, J., Dumas, Y., Solomon, M.M., Villeneuve, D., A request clustering algorithm for door to door handicapped transportation (1995) Transportation Science, 29, pp. 63-78; Jaw, J.J., Odoni, A.R., Psaraftis, H.N., Wilson, N.H.M., A heuristic algorithm for the multi-vehicle many to many advance request dial-a-ride problem (1986) Transportation Research, 20 B, pp. 243-257; Madsen, O.B.G., Raven, H.F., Rygaard, J.M., A heuristic algorithm for a dial-a-ride problem with time windows, multiple capacities, and multiple objectives (1995) Annals of Operations Research, 60, pp. 193-208; Mitrovic-Minic, S., Krishnamurti, R., Laporte, G., Double-horizon based heuristics for the dynamic pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2004) Transportation Research, 38 B, pp. 669-685; Psaraftis, H.N., A dynamic programming solution to the single vehicle many-to-many immediate request dial-a-ride problem (1980) Transportation Science, 14, pp. 130-154; Psaraftis, H.N., An exact algorithm for the single vehicle many-to-many dial-a-ride problem with time windows (1983) Transportation Science, 17, pp. 351-357; Sexton, T.R., Bodin, L.D., Optimizing single vehicle many-to-many operations with desired delivery times (1985) Transportation Science, 19, pp. 378-410; Sexton, T.R., Bodin, L.D., Optimizing single vehicle many-to-many operations with desired delivery times (1985) Transportation Science, 19, pp. 411-435; Solomon, M.M., Algorithms for the vehicle routing and scheduling problems with time windows constraints (1987) Operations Research, 35, pp. 254-265; Toth, P., Vigo, D., Heuristic algorithms for the handicapped persons transportation problem (1997) Transportation Science, 31, pp. 60-71",,,,,,,,,09696016,,,,"English","Int.

Routing a fleet of vehicles for dynamic combined pickup and delivery services. In: Proceedings of the Symposium on Operation Research 2001, Springer-Verlag, Berlin/Heidelberg, pp. 3-8.]. The authors assume that every client names a stretch-factor that denotes the maximal relative deviation from the shortest path between pickup and delivery point. Waiting times are not allowed. As these assumptions are not very realistic, this paper now presents the results of adapting this algorithm to the dynamic pickup and delivery vehicle routing problem with several time windows. Waiting times of vehicles are admitted. Moreover, the computational results are considerably improved by local search techniques making use of free computational capacity. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

These companies serve customers that require transportation of a package from a pickup location to a delivery location. This paper presents an empirical study on usefulness of transshipment points in such a context. Transshipment allows for a request to be served by two vehicles: one vehicle collects the load at the pickup location, drops it at a transshipment point, and another vehicle carries the load to the delivery location. The motivation for this work came from the practice observed in a large San Francisco based courier company that allows transshipment of loads between vehicles. The company serves large geographic area covering several neighboring cities. The main reasoning behind allowing transshipment lies in the idea of keeping drivers in their home area. We have investigated a generalization of this transshipment practice, allowing vehicles to move through entire service area in order to evaluate the usefulness of transshipment. We identify circumstances under which transshipment may be beneficial.","Pickup and delivery; Time windows; Transshipment","Automobile drivers; Freight transportation; Ground vehicles; Motivation; Operations research; Courier companies; Pickup and delivery; Time windows; Transshipment; Distribution of goods",,,,,"Benyahia, I., Potvin, J.-Y., Decision support for vehicle dispatching using genetic programming (1998) IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans, 28, pp. 306-314; Borndörfer, R., Grötschel, M., Klostermeier, F., Kütner, A., (1997) Telebus Berlin: Vehicle Scheduling in a Dial-a-ride System, , Technical Report SC 97-23, Konrad-Zuse-Zentrum für Informationstechnik Berlin; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research B, 37, pp. 579-594; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem: Variants, modeling issues and algorithms (2003) Quarterly Journal of the Belgian, French and Italian Operations Research Societies, 1, pp. 89-101; Desrosiers, J., Dumas, Y., Soumis, F., Taillefer, S., Villeneuve, D., (1991) An Algorithm for Mini-clustering in Handicapped Transport, , Les cahiers du GERAD G-91-02, Ecole des Hautes Études Commerciales, Montreal; Dumas, Y., Desrosiers, J., Soumis, F., The pickup and delivery problem with time windows (1991) European Journal of Operational Research, 54, pp. 7-22; Gendreau, M., Guertin, F., Potvin, J.-Y., Séguin, R., Neighborhood search heuristics for a dynamic vehicle dispatching problem with pick-ups and deliveries (2006) Transportation Research C, , Forthcoming; Gendreau, M., Potvin, J.-Y., Dynamic vehicle routing and dispatching (1998) Fleet Management and Logistics, pp. 115-126. , T.

The objective of the scheduler is to design a set of routes which minimizes the total service cost, capable of providing service to all requests. Existing approaches on the DARP focus on the static version of the problem. The objective of this paper is to develop an efficient strategy for the dynamic dial-a-ride problem to describe how the operator should response to the requests and manage the vehicles, taking into account the real-time characteristics and stochastic effects.

We target ADMSs where an ADMS consists of two sub-systems: a Production System(PS) and an Autonomous Transportation System(ATS). This paper discusses an on-line Tasks Assignment and Routing Problem(TARP) for ATSs under conditions of given production schedule and finite buffer capacity. The TARP results in a constrained version of a Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows(PDPTW). In our previous work, a mathematical formulation of the problem was given, and a cooperative algorithm to obtain sub-optimal routes while avoiding deadlocks and buffer over-flows was proposed. In this paper, by computational experiments, we will examine the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Computational experiments show that the proposed algorithm can make efficient and deadlockfree routes even though the buffer capacity is less. © 2005 IEEE.",,"Autonomous distributed vehicles systems; Cooperative algorithms; Finite buffer capacity; Production Systems (PS); Buffer storage; Computational methods; Distributed computer systems; Problem solving; Algorithms",,,,,"Baker, A.D., A survey of factory control algorithms that can be implemented in a multi-agent heterarchy: Dispatching, scheduling, and pull (1998) Journal of Manufacturing Systems, 17 (4), pp. 297-320; Giret, A., Botti, V., Holons and agents (2004) Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, 15, pp. 645-659; http://www.ims.org, IMS Center; Chan, F.T.S., Chan, H.K., A comprehensive survey and future trend of simulation study on FMS scheduling (2004) Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, 15 (1), pp. 87-102; Vis, I.F.A., Survey of research in the design and control of automated guided vehicle systems European Journal of Operational Research, , in press, available online; Shen, W., Norrie, D.H., Agent-Based Systems for Intelligent Manufacturing: A State-of-the-Art Survey (1999) Knowledge and Information Systems, 1 (2), pp. 129-156; Bordin, L.D., Assad, A., Ball, M., Routing and scheduling of vehicles and crews: The state of the art (1983) Computers & Operations Research, 10 (2), pp. 63-67; Psaraftis, H., An Exact Algorithm for the Single Vehicle Many-to-Many Dial-A-Ride Problem with Time Windows (1983) Transportation Science, 17 (3), pp. 351-357; Desrosiers, J., Dumas, Y., Soumis, F., A Dynamic Programming Solution of the Large-Scale SingleVehicle Dial-a-Ride Problem with Time Windows (1986) American Journal of Mathematical and Management Sciences, 6 (3), pp. 301-325; Ruland, K., Rodyn, E., The Pickup and Delivery Problem: Faces and Branch-and-Cut Algorithm (1997) Computers Math.

We target ADMSs where an ADMS consists of two sub-systems: a Production System (PS) and an Autonomous Transportation System (ATS). This paper discusses an on-line Tasks Assignment and Routing Problem (TARP) for ATSs under conditions of given production schedule and finite buffer capacity. The TARP results in a constrained version of the Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (PDPTW), and this paper gives a mathematical formulation of the problem. This paper, also, proposes a cooperative algorithm to obtain suboptimal solutions in which no deadlocks and buffer overflows occur. By computational experiments, we will examine the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Computational experiments show that the proposed algorithm is able to obtain efficient and deadlock-free routes even though the buffer p capacity is less.

Courier service is a typical example. The imposition of precedence constraints among the places to be visited constitutes a variant of the classical Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). This well-known np-hard problem is often solved by heuristics. The Precedence-Constrained TSP that incorporates Delivery and Pickup (PCTDP) is a much harder problem to solve. This paper addresses the PCTDP and presents a three-stage heuristic using clustering and shrink-wrap algorithm for finding an initial path as well as genetic algorithms for the final search to obtain the best solution. The proposed heuristic is tested over a range of trial datasets and is found to give encouraging results. With its ability to provide solutions of good quality at low computing times, the proposed heuristic has ample scope for application as an automated scheduler when implemented at the site of a logistics-planning cell. © 2005 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","delivery and pickup;

While it has been reported that such systems improve the usability of bus systems when applied in a small town or area, it is not obvious how and under what conditions the systems are effective in comparison to traditional fixed-route bus systems. We conducted two computer simulations of dial-a-ride and fixed-route systems in order to compare the usability and profitability of both systems. Simulation results indicated that: (1) The usability of the dial-a-ride system with a fixed number of buses drops very quickly when the number of requests(demands) increases. (2) When we increase the number of buses proportionally to the number of demand, the usability of the dial-a-ride system is improved more significantly than that of the fixed-route system. (3) When frequency of demands is sufficiently, the dial-a-ride system is a reasonable solution from the both usability and profitability perspectives. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.",,"Demands; Profitability; Public transport systems; Vehicle routing problem; Bus systems; Dial-a-Ride; Dial-a-ride systems; Fixed numbers; Small towns; Transportation system; Urban areas; Bus transportation; Buses; Computer simulation; Highway traffic control; Transportation routes; Traveling salesman problem; Buses; Multi agent systems; Profitability; Urban transportation; Problem solving; Usability engineering",,,,,"Krumke, S.O., De Paepe, W.E., Poensgen, D., Stougie, L., News from the online traveling repairman (2001) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2136, pp. 487-496; Bianco, L., Mingozzi, A., Riccaiardelli, S., Spadoni, M., Exact and heuristic procedures for the traveling salesman problem with precedence constraints, based on dynamic programming (1994) INFOR, 32, pp. 19-31; William, A., Bailey, J., Thomas, D., Clark, J., A simulation analysis of demand and fleet size effects on taxicab service rates (1987) Proceedings of the 19th Conference on Winter Simulation, pp. 838-844. , ACM Press; Savelsbergh, M.W.P., Sol, M., The general pickup and delivery program (1995) Transportation Science, 29, pp. 17-29; Bodin, L.D., Golden, B.L., Assad, A., Ball, M.O., Routing and scheduling of vehicles and crews: The state of the art (1983) Computers and Operation Research, 10, pp. 63-211; Ruland, K.S., Rodin, E.Y., The pickup and delivery problem: Faces and branch-and-cut algorithm (1997) Computers Math.

In the dynamic DARP, requests are received throughout the day and the primary objective is to accept as many requests as possible while satisfying operational constraints. This article describes and compares a number of parallel implementations of a Tabu search heuristic previously developed for the static DARP, i.e., the variant of the problem where all requests are known in advance.

This article focuses on the dynamic PDPTW for which future requests are not stochastically modelled or predicted. The standard solution methodology for the dynamic PDPTW is the use of a rolling time horizon as proposed by Psaraftis. When assigning a new request to a vehicle it may be preferable to consider the impact of a decision both on a short-term and on a long-term horizon. In particular, better managing slack time in the distant future may help reduce routing cost. This paper describes double-horizon based heuristics for the dynamic PDPTW. Computational results show the advantage of using a double-horizon in conjunction with insertion and improvement heuristics. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.
