A request is composed of several pickups of different items, followed by a single delivery at the client location. We formally describe, model and solve this rich and new problem in the field of pickup and delivery vehicle routing. We solve the problem exactly via branch-and-bound and heuristically developing a hybrid adaptive large neighborhood search with improvement operations. Several new removal and insertion operators are developed to tackle the special precedence constraints, which can be used in other pickup and delivery problems. Computational results are reported on different types of instances to study the performance of the developed algorithms, highlighting the performance of our heuristic compared to the exact method, and assessing its sensibility to different parameter settings. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Multi-pickup and delivery problem; Sequential ordering problem; Vehicle routing problem","Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Optimization; Pickups; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Adaptive large neighborhood searches; Computational results; Pickup and delivery; Pickup and delivery problem with time windows; Pickup and delivery problems; Precedence constraints; Sequential ordering problems; Vehicle Routing Problems; Problem solving",,,,,"Ai, T.J., Kachitvichyanukul, V., A particle swarm optimization for the vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickup and delivery (2009) Computers & Operations Research, 36 (5), pp. 1693-1702; Alonso-Ayuso, A., Detti, P., Escudero, L.F., Ortuño, M.T., On dual based lower bounds for the sequential ordering problem with precedences and due dates (2003) Annals of Operations Research, 124 (1-4), pp. 111-131; Ascheuer, N., Jünger, M., Reinelt, G., A branch & cut algorithm for the asymmetric traveling salesman problem with precedence constraints (2000) Computational Optimization and Applications, 17 (1), pp. 61-84; Balas, E., Fischetti, M., Pulleyblank, W.R., The precedence-constrained asymmetric traveling salesman polytope (1995) Mathematical Programming, 68 (1-3), pp. 241-265; Baldacci, R., Bartolini, E., Mingozzi, A., An exact algorithm for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2011) Operations Research, 59 (2), pp. 414-426; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Gribkovskaia, I., Laporte, G., Static pickup and delivery problems: A classification scheme and survey (2007) Top, 15 (1), pp. 1-31; Bortfeldt, A., Hahn, T., Männel, D., Mönch, L., Hybrid algorithms for the vehicle routing problem with clustered backhauls and 3d loading constraints (2015) European Journal of Operational Research, 243 (1), pp. 82-96; Coelho, L., Renaud, J., Laporte, G., Road-based goods transportation: a survey of real-world logistics applications from 2000 to 2015 (2016) INFOR: Information Systems and Operational Research, 54 (2), pp. 79-96; Coelho, L.C., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Consistency in multi-vehicle inventory-routing (2012) Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 24 (1), pp. 270-287; Coelho, L.C., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The inventory-routing problem with transshipment (2012) Computers & Operations Research, 39 (11), pp. 2537-2548; Desaulniers, G., Desrosiers, J., Erdmann, A., Solomon, M.M., Soumis, F., VRP with pickup and delivery (2001) The vehicle routing problem, pp. 225-242. , P.

To a high degree these needs can be fulfilled by individual and public transport. People that do not have access to the former and cannot use the latter require additional means of transportation. This is where dial-a-ride services come into play. The dial-a-ride problem considers transportation requests of people from pick-up to drop-off locations. Users specify time windows with respect to these points. Requests are served by a given vehicle fleet with limited capacity and tour duration per vehicle. Moreover, user inconvenience considerations are taken into account by limiting the travel time between origin and destination for each request. Previous research on the dial-a-ride problem primarily focused on serving a given set of requests with a fixed-size vehicle fleet at minimal traveling costs. It is assumed that the request set is sufficiently small to be served by the available vehicles. We consider a different scenario in which a maximal number of requests shall be served under the given constraints, i.e., it is no longer guaranteed that all requests can be accepted. For this new problem variant we propose a compact mixed integer linear programming model as well as algorithms based on Benders decomposition. In particular, we employ logic-based Benders decomposition and branch-and-check using mixed integer linear programming and constraint programming algorithms. We consider different variants on how to generate Benders cuts as well as heuristic boosting techniques and different types of valid inequalities. Computational experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the suggested algorithms. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Branch-and-check; Combinatorial Benders cuts; Dial-a-Ride problem; Logic-based Benders decomposition; Transportation","Computation theory; Computer circuits; Computer programming; Constraint theory; Fleet operations; Stochastic programming; Transportation; Travel time; Vehicles; Branch-and-check; Combinatorial Benders cuts; Computational experiment; Dial-a-ride problem; Logic-based benders decompositions; Means of transportations; Mixed integer linear programming; Mixed integer linear programming model; Integer programming",,,,,"Baklagis, D.G., Dikas, G., Minis, I., The team orienteering pick-up and delivery problem with time windows and its applications in fleet sizing (2016) RAIRO-Oper.

A key characteristic of these problems is that the matching of servers/services to customers in one stage has a direct impact on the matching in the next stage. For instance, it is efficient for taxis to pick up customers closer to the drop off point of the customer from the first stage of matching. Traditionally, greedy/myopic approaches have been adopted to address such large scale online matching problems. While they provide solutions in a scalable manner, due to their myopic nature, the quality of matching obtained can be improved significantly (demonstrated in our experimental results). In this paper, we present a multi-stage stochastic optimization formulation to consider potential future demand scenarios (obtained from past data). We then provide an enhancement to solve large scale problems more effectively and efficiently online. We also provide the worst-case theoretical bounds on the performance of different approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the significant improvement provided by our techniques over myopic approaches and two other multi-stage approaches from literature (Approximate Dynamic Programming and Hybrid Multi-Stage Stochastic optimization formulation) on three real world taxi data sets. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","MDPs; Online linear programming; Online matching; Stochastic optimization","Linear programming; Problem solving; Sales; Stochastic systems; Taxicabs; Approximate dynamic programming; Key characteristics; Large-scale problem; MDPs; Multistage approach; On-line matching; Stochastic optimizations; Theoretical bounds; Dynamic programming",,,,,"Lowalekar, M., Varakantham, P., Jaillet, P., Online spatio-temporal matching in stochastic and dynamic domains (2016) AAAI, pp. 3271-3277; Agatz, N., Erera, A.L., Savelsbergh, M.W., Wang, X., Dynamic ride-sharing: a simulation study in metro Atlanta (2011) Proc., Soc.

Customer requests are to be redistributed among participants, such that the total cost is minimized. We formulate the problem as multi-depot traveling salesman problem with pickups and deliveries. We apply three well-established exact solution approaches and compare their performance in terms of computational time. To avoid unrealistic solutions with unevenly distributed workload, we extend the problem by introducing minimum workload constraints. Our computational results show that, while for the original problem Benders decomposition is the method of choice, for the newly formulated problem this method is clearly dominated by the proposed column generation approach. The obtained results can be used as benchmarks for decentralized mechanisms in collaborative pickup and delivery problems. © 2017, The Author(s).","Collaborations; Exact solutions; Traveling salesman problem; Vehicle routing",,,,,,"Adenso-Díaz, B., Lozano, S., Garcia-Carbajal, S., Smith-Miles, K., Assessing partnership savings in horizontal cooperation by planning linked deliveries (2014) Transp Res A Pol Pract, 66, pp. 268-279; Archetti, C., Speranza, M., Vigo, D., Vehicle routing problems with profits.

In this new variant of the dial-a-ride problem, en-route modifications of the vehicle's inner configuration are allowed. The main consequence is that the vehicle capacity is defined by a set of configurations and the choice of vehicle configuration is associated with binary decision variables. The problem is modeled as a mixed-integer program derived from the model of the heterogeneous dial-a-ride problem. Vehicle reconfiguration is a lever to efficiently reduce transportation costs, but the number of passengers and vehicle fleet setting make this problem intractable for exact solution methods. A large neighborhood search metaheuristic combined with a set covering component with a reactive mechanism to automatically adjust its parameters is therefore proposed. The resulting framework is evaluated against benchmarks from the literature, used for similar routing problems. It is also applied to a real case, in the context of the transportation of disabled children from their home to medical centers in the city of Lyon, France. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Dial-a-ride problem; Feasibility check; Fleet size and mix problem; Heterogeneous fleet; Large neighborhood search; Reconfigurable vehicles; Set-covering","Integer programming; Vehicles; Dial-a-ride problem; Feasibility check; Fleet size and mixes; Heterogeneous fleet; Large neighborhood search; Reconfigurable; Set coverings; Fleet operations; cost analysis; decision making; disability; technology adoption; transportation technology; travel behavior; Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes; France; Grand Lyon; Lyons",,,,,"Archetti, C., Speranza, M.G., A survey on matheuristics for routing problems (2014) EURO J.

Planning daily PMC transport for ARG ships and nearby airfields is a unique vehicle routing problem characterized by a heterogeneous capacitated vehicle fleet, two cargo types, multiple depots, time windows, and synchronized routing of two aircraft required between some but not all node pairs. We formulate this problem as an integer linear program (ILP) with an objective function that expresses the cost of flight operations and a penalty for undelivered PMC. We perform extensive computational testing using an ILP solver and a tailored ant colony optimization with local search metaheuristic on test instances constructed to represent those found in practice. We find most instances difficult to solve optimally while our heuristic provides the best known or close to the best known solution in just a few minutes. We have embedded our heuristic in a decision support system complete with graphical user interface and sent this out for use by United States Navy ARG planners. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Ant colony optimization; Integer linear programming; Local search; Military; Vehicle routing",,,,,,"Barbarosoğlu, G., Özdamar, L., Cevik, A., An interactive approach for hierarchical analysis of helicopter logistics in disaster relief operations (2002) European Journal of Operational Research, 140 (1), pp. 118-133; Belanger, N., Desaulniers, G., Soumis, F., Desrosiers, J., Periodic airline fleet assignment with time windows, spacing constraints, and time dependent revenues (2006) European Journal of Operational Research, 175 (3), pp. 1754-1766; Bent, R., Van Hentenryck, P., A two-stage hybrid algorithm for pickup and delivery vehicle routing problems with time windows (2006) Computers & Operations Research, 33 (4), pp. 875-893; Braekers, K., Caris, A., Janssens, G.K., Exact and meta-heuristic approach for a general heterogeneous dial-a-ride problem with multiple depots (2014) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 67, pp. 166-186; Bredström, D., Rönnqvist, M., Combined vehicle routing and scheduling with temporal precedence and synchronization constraints (2008) European Journal of Operational Research, 191 (1), pp. 19-31; Brown, G.G., Carlyle, W.M., Dell, R.F., Optimizing intratheater military airlift in iraq and afghanistan (2013) Military Operations Research, 18 (3), pp. 35-52; Cherkesly, M., Desaulniers, G., Irnich, S., Laporte, G., Branch-price-and-cut algorithms for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows and multiple stacks (2016) European Journal of Operational Research, 250 (3), pp. 782-793; Cheung, R.K., Shi, N., Powell, W.B., Simao, H.P., An attribute-decision model for cross-border drayage problem (2008) Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 44 (2), pp. 217-234; Cordeau, J.-F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54 (3), pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem (darp): Variants, modeling issues and algorithms (2003) Quarterly Journal of the Belgian, French and Italian Operations Research Societies, 1 (2), pp. 89-101; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 37 (6), pp. 579-594; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem: Models and algorithms (2007) Annals of Operations Research, 153 (1), pp. 29-46; Dantzig, G.B., Ramser, J.H., The truck dispatching problem (1959) Management Science, 6 (1), pp. 80-91; De Rosa, B., Improta, G., Ghiani, G., Musmanno, R., The arc routing and scheduling problem with transshipment (2002) Transportation Science, 36 (3), pp. 301-313; Del Pia, A., Filippi, C., A variable neighborhood descent algorithm for a real waste collection problem with mobile depots (2006) International Transactions in Operational Research, 13 (2), pp. 125-141; Desaulniers, G., Desrosiers, J., Erdmann, A., Solomon, M.M., Soumis, F., Vrp with pickup and delivery (2002) SIAM Monographs on Discrete Mathematics and Applications, pp. 225-242; Desrosiers, J., Dumas, Y., Soumis, F., A dynamic programming solution of the large-scale single-vehicle dial—a-ride problem with time windows (1986) American Journal of Mathematical and Management Sciences, 6 (3-4), pp. 301-325; Detti, P., Papalini, F., de Lara, G.Z.M., A multi-depot dial-a-ride problem with heterogeneous vehicles and compatibility constraints in healthcare (2017) Omega, 70, pp. 1-14; Dorigo, M., Stützle, T., Ant colony optimization: Overview and recent advances (2010) Handbook of Metaheuristics, pp. 227-263. , M.

The Dial-a-Ride Problems (DARP) is one of the traditional transportation services of mobility on demand. The objective of standard Dial-a-Ride Problem (DARP) is to minimize total travel cost. However, most of DARP applications are designed for disabled and elderly people to provide more convenient and friendly services. Thus, the profit or operational cost should not be the only consideration. In addition to travel cost, the objective functions should include service quality and eco-efficiency. In order to consider three conflicting objectives simultaneously, the speed level constraints are added to the model. We defined a set of speed levels, and these constraints ensure that only one speed is selected for each arc. Mathematical models are described for each objective and computational experiments are performed on realistic instances. © 2017 IEEE.","Dial-a-Ride Problems (DARP); Eco-efficiency; Service quality","Costs; Efficiency; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Quality of service; Computational experiment; Conflicting objectives; Dial-a-ride problem; Eco-efficiency; Multi-objective modeling; Public transportation; Service Quality; Transportation services; Vehicle to vehicle communications",,,,,"Barth, M., Younglove, T., Scora, G., Development of a heavy-duty diesel modal emissions and fuel consumption model (2005) California Partners for Advanced Transit and Highways (PATH); Barth, M., Boriboonsomsin, K., Energy and emissions impacts of a freeway-based dynamic eco-driving system (2009) Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 14 (6), pp. 400-410; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem (DARP): Variants, modeling issues and algorithms (2003) Quarterly Journal of the Belgian, French and Italian Operations Research Societies, 1 (2), pp. 89-101; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem: Models and algorithms (2007) Annals of Operations Research, 153 (1), pp. 29-46; Demir, E., Bekta, T., Laporte, G., An adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic for the pollution-routing problem (2012) European Journal of Operational Research, 223 (2), pp. 346-359; Falcocchio, J., (1979) A Methodology for Evaluating the Effectiveness of Transportation Improvements for the Elderly and Handicapped, , No TR-78/503 Final Rpt; Grodzevich, O., Romanko, O., Normalization and other topics in multi-objective optimization (2006) Proceedings of the Fields MITACS Industrial Problems Workshop, , Toronto, Canada; Hickman, J., Hassel, D., Joumard, R., Samaras, Z., Sorenson, S., MEET-Methodology for calculating transport emissions and energy consumption (1999) European Commission, , DG VII.

Each customer has a demand, characterized by a weight, and pickups and deliveries are performed by a single ship of given weight capacity. The ship is able to visit a port only if the amount of cargo it carries is compatible with the draft limit of the port. We present an integer linear programming formulation and we show how classical valid inequalities from the literature can be adapted to the considered problem. We introduce heuristic procedures and a branch-and-cut exact algorithm.

In the standard problem, operational costs are minimized, subject to full demand satisfaction and service level requirements. However, to enhance the practical applicability of solution methods, authors increasingly focus on problem variants that adopt additional real-life characteristics. First, this work introduces an up-to-date classification that distinguishes multiple categories of real-life characteristics. Second, the wide range of solution methods proposed in the literature is reviewed in a structured manner. Although the existing literature is reviewed exhaustively, specific attention is devoted to recent developments. Third, an extensive overview table provides full details on all problem characteristics and solution methods applied in each paper discussed.

This paper investigates the operational effects of horizontal cooperation among dial-a-ride providers. The current practice is that users choose a particular provider to submit their requests. Providers operating in the same area create their routing solutions independently of each other, given their own set of customers. In contrast, horizontal cooperation through joint route planning implies that customer requests can be exchanged among providers in order to minimize the overall routing cost. In addition to quantifying the operational benefits generated by such a horizontal cooperation, this paper identifies operational characteristics that influence the magnitude of the savings. A real-life case study reveals the reasons why providers benefit from certain request exchanges, as well as the extent to which these exchanges are predictable in advance. The solutions are obtained using a large neighborhood search algorithm that performs well on benchmark data. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Demand-responsive transportation; Dial-a-ride services; Horizontal cooperation; Joint route planning",,,,,,"Anderson, D., Sweeney, D., Williams, T., Freeman, J., Shoesmith, E., Statistics for Business and Economics (2010), CENGAGE Learning Business Press; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Dynamic pickup and delivery problems (2010) Euro.

Consequently, our primary objective is to explore solutions for real-world VRPs with a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles, multi-depot subcontractors (drivers), and pickup/delivery time window and location constraints. We use a nested bi-criteria genetic algorithm (GA) to minimize the total time to complete all jobs with the fewest number of route drivers. Our model will explore the issue of weighting the objectives (total time vs. number of drivers) and provide Pareto front solutions that can be used to make decisions on a case-by-case basis. Three different real-world data sets were used to compare the results of our GA vs. transportation field experts’ job assignments. For the three data sets, all 21 Pareto efficient solutions yielded improved overall job completion times. In 57 % (12/21) of the cases, the Pareto efficient solutions also utilized fewer drivers than the field experts’ job allocation strategies. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Bi-criteria genetic algorithm; Hard and soft time windows; Multi-depot transportation problem; Pareto front; Vehicle routing problem","Algorithms; Fleet operations; Network routing; Pareto principle; Routing algorithms; Transportation routes; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Virtual reality; Bi-criteria; Pareto front; Soft time windows; Transportation problem; Vehicle Routing Problems; Genetic algorithms",,,,,"Abounacer, R., Rekik, M., Renaud, J., An exact solution approach for multi-objective location transportation problem for disaster response (2012) CIRRELT, 26, pp. 1-32; Aneja, Y.P., Nair, P.K., (1979) Bicriteria transportation problem.

The assumption of flexible depots allows the vehicle to end its route at any depot. As a result, the total travel cost may be reduced. A mixed integer nonlinear programming model was firstly formulated for the considered problem. To make the MHDARP-FD tractable, the original model was reformulated by linearizing constraints, aggregating variables, and strengthening model.

This problem is motivated by a case study carried out in an oil company that operates in Brazil. Based on this study, we propose a mixed integer programming model that extends the classical pickup and delivery problem with time windows. This problem belongs to the NP-hard class and its solution is very challenging in practice. To model specific features of the addressed case, we include new constraints in the classical formulation, which makes it even more challenging for general purpose optimization solvers. To overcome this, we propose two branch-and-cut methods that use valid inequalities especially developed for the oil company case. Computational results performed with a real data set provided by the company show that the proposed branch-and-cut methods are effective and able to solve more instances than a state of the art general purpose optimization solver.","Branch-and-cut method; Oil industry; Pickup and delivery problem; Ship routing and scheduling",,,,,,"Andersson, H., Hoff, A., Christiansen, M., Hasle, G., Løkketangen, A., Industrial aspects and literature survey: Combined inventory management and routing (2010) Computers & Operations Research, 37 (9), pp. 1515-1536. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cor.2009.11.009; Balas, E., Fischetti, M., Pulleyblank, W.R., The precedence-constrained asymmetric travelling salesman polytope (1995) Mathematical Programming, 68 (1-3), pp. 214-265. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01585767; Baldacci, R., Bartolini, E., Mingozzi, A., An exact algorithm for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2011) Operations Research, 59 (2), pp. 414-426. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/opre.1100.0881; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.F., Gribkovskaia, I., Laporte, G., Static pickup and delivery problems: A classification scheme and survey (2007) Top, 15 (1), pp. 1-31. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11750-007-0009-0; (2011) Recuperado em 30 de Abril de 2012, , http://www.mdic.gov.br/sitio/, de; Brønmo, G., Nygreen, B., Lysgaard, J., Column generation approaches to ship scheduling with flexible cargo sizes (2010) European Journal of Operational Research, 200 (1), pp. 139-150. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2008.12.028; Christiansen, M., Decomposition of a combined inventory and time constrained ship routing problem (1999) Transportation Science, 33 (1), pp. 1-14. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/trsc.33.1.3; Christiansen, M., Fagerholt, K., Ronen, D., Ship routing and scheduling: Status and perspectives (2004) Transportation Science, 38 (1), pp. 1-18. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/trsc.1030.0036; Christiansen, M., Fagerholt, K., Ronen, D., Nygreen, B., Maritime transportation (2007) Handbook in Operations Research and Management Science, pp. 189-284. , C.

Quality is ensured by taking into account service level requirements. However, little research has been conducted into the effect of service level variations on operational costs incurred by service providers. This study investigates the evolution of operational costs for 78 combinations of two service level parameters, being the maximum deviation from a user’s preference time and the relative maximum exceedance of a user’s direct ride time. A distinction is made between various operating circumstances, including the size of the service provider, the traffic conditions in the service area and the heterogeneity of the customers. The resulting tradeoffs between quality and costs should encourage service providers to make informed decisions regarding potential changes in the service level they offer. The sensitivity analysis in this paper is performed on well-known benchmark data from literature and applies a state-of-the-art deterministic annealing metaheuristic to compute operational costs. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Demand-responsive transportation; Deterministic annealing; Dial-a-ride; Operational costs; Service level",,,,,,"Anderson, D.R., Sweeney, D.J., Williams, T.A., Freeman, J., Shoesmith, E., (2010) Statistics for business and economics, , CENGAGE Learning Business Press, Boston; Ben-Akiva, M., Benjamin, J., Lauprete, G.J., Polydoropoulou, A., Impact of advanced public transportation systems on travel by dial-a-ride (1996) Transp Res Rec, 1557, pp. 72-79; Braekers, K., Caris, A., Janssens, G.K., Exact and meta-heuristic approach for a general heterogeneous dial-a-ride problem with multiple depots (2014) Transp Res Part B: Methodol, 67, pp. 166-186; Cordeau, J.-F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Oper Res, 54 (3), pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J.-F., Gendreau, M., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for periodic and multi-depot vehicle routing problems (1997) Networks, 30, pp. 105-119; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transp Res Part B: Methodol, 37 (6), pp. 579-594; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem: models and algorithms (2007) Ann Oper Res, 153 (1), pp. 29-46; Cubillos, C., Paolo, F., Mascia, M., Zunino, C., On user requirements and operator purposes in dial-a-ride services (2002) Proceedings of the 9th meeting of the EURO working group on transportation; Jaw, J.-J., Odoni, A.R., Psaraftis, H.N., Wilson, N.H.M., A heuristic algorithm for the multi-vehicle advance-request dial-a-ride problem with time windows (1986) Transp Res Part B: Methodol, 20, pp. 243-257; Lin, S., Kernighan, B.W., An effective heuristic algorithm for the traveling salesman problem (1973) Oper Res, 21 (2), pp. 498-516; Marković, N., Nair, R., Schonfeld, P., Miller-Hooks, E., Mohebbi, M., Optimizing dial-a-ride services in maryland.

In this problem, the loading compartment of a vehicle is modeled as a linear LIFO stack. When an item is picked up, it is positioned on top of the stack. When it is on top of the stack, it can be delivered without additional handling. Otherwise, items on top must be unloaded before the delivery and reloaded afterwards, which requires time. We define two rehandling policies. For both policies, rehandling is only allowed at delivery locations and there is no specific reloading order for the rehandled items. Under the first policy, only compulsory rehandling is allowed. Under the second policy, in addition to compulsory rehandling, preventive rehandling is allowed. For each policy, we propose a branch-price-and-cut algorithm with an ad hoc dominance criterion for the labeling algorithm used to generate routes.

The author denotes to this new variant as the 1-commodity pickup-and-delivery vehicle routing problem with soft time windows (1-PDVRPTW). Design/methodology/approach: The author proposes a hybrid genetic algorithm and a scatter search to solve the 1-PDVRPTW. It proposes a new constructive heuristic to generate the initial population solution and a scatter search (SS) after the crossover and mutation operators as a local search. The hybrid genetic scatter search replaces two steps in SS with crossover and mutation, respectively. Findings: So, the author proposes a greedy local search algorithm as a metaheuristic to solve the 1-PDVRPTW. Then, the author proposes to hybridize the metaheuristic to solve this variant and to make a good comparison with solutions presented in the literature. Originality/value: The author considers that this is the first application in one commodity. The solution methodology based on scatter search method combines a set of diverse and high-quality candidate solutions by considering the weights and constraints of each solution. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Metaheuristic;

It studies the impact of combination restrictions, preventing particular user combinations and limiting the set of drivers to which particular users can be assigned. The academic literature currently lacks insights into the effect of these restrictions on the cost structure of a service provider. A multi-directional local search algorithm is developed to solve this problem, taking into account the fundamental tradeoff between operational efficiency and service quality. Local search is integrated into a variable neighborhood descent framework that applies an intelligent candidate list principle to reduce computation time. Moreover, a new scheduling procedure is proposed, constructing time schedules that minimize total user ride time. It proves to be faster and more efficient than existing scheduling procedures. Overall, computational experiments on existing benchmark data extended with combination restrictions reveal a general pattern in the effect of the combination restrictions. Such insights are essential for service providers in order to support policy choices, e.g. related to service quality or medical education of drivers. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Bi-objective optimization;

Typically, several users with different pickup and dropoff locations are transported on a vehicle simultaneously. The focus in dial-a-ride problems (DARPs) is mainly on minimizing routing cost. Service quality has been taken into account in the models by imposing time windows and limiting the maximum ride time of each user. We extend the classical DARP by an additional feature of service quality referred to as driver consistency. Customers of dial-a-ride services are often sensitive to changes in their daily routine. This aspect includes the person who is providing the transportation service, i.e., the driver of the vehicle. Our problem, called the driver consistent dial-a-ride problem (DC-DARP), considers driver consistency by bounding the maximum number of different drivers that transport a user over a multi-period planning horizon. We propose different formulations of the problem and examine their efficiency when applied in a Branch-and-Cut fashion. Additionally, we develop a large neighborhood search algorithm that generates near-optimal solutions in a short amount of time. Over 1000 instances are generated with close reference to real world scenarios. Extensive computational experiments are conducted in order to assess the quality of the solution approaches and to provide insights into the new problem. Results reveal that the cost of offering driver consistency varies greatly in magnitude. Depending on the instance, the cost of assigning one driver to each user can be up to 27.98% higher compared to a low-cost solution.

We are given a set of requests and a homogeneous fleet of vehicles. A set of routes of minimum total length has to be determined such that each request is transported from a loading site to the corresponding unloading site. In the 3L-PDP, each request is given as a set of 3D rectangular items (boxes) and the vehicle capacity is replaced by a 3D loading space. We investigate which constraints will ensure that no reloading effort will occur, i.e. that no box is moved after loading and before unloading. A spectrum of 3L-PDP variants is introduced with different characteristics in terms of reloading effort. We propose a hybrid algorithm for solving the 3L-PDP consisting of a routing and a packing procedure. The routing procedure modifies a well-known large neighborhood search for the 1D-PDP. A tree search heuristic is responsible for packing boxes. Computational experiments were carried out using 54 newly proposed 3L-PDP benchmark instances. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Efficient ridesharing solutions could help mitigate congestion. Some of the actions that government agencies have taken to encourage ridesharing include the availability of high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes and existing policies of discounted toll rates on HOVs. These measures encourage ridesharing by reducing costs or travel times of such trips. To study how the optimal routes change as a function of incentives for ridesharing, we modified existing pickup and delivery problems with time windows to consider changes in passenger travel time and toll cost due to vehicle load. Our computational results explore how the total route cost and time are affected by the use of HOV lanes and toll savings. In addition, our results show that it can be beneficial from a time and cost perspective to take detours to pick up additional passengers and use HOV lanes when the time saving on HOV lanes is significant. © 2016 W.

Dial-a-ride problem differs from other routing and scheduling problems with time windows in that it typically involves service-related constraints such as maximum ride time constraints. Most of the models for dial-a-ride problem reported in the literature assume constant travel times. Clearly, ignoring the fact that the travel time between two locations does not depend only on the distance traveled, but also on the time of the day traveled, impact the application of these models to real-world problems, in that the schedule of the route may be infeasible in the time-dependent cases. In this paper, we present a heuristic algorithm based on time-dependent travel times to assure, given a sequence of pickups and deliveries, whether a feasible schedule exists. We demonstrate that this can be done in O(n2) time. © 2016 IEEE.","Dial-a-ride Problem; First-in-first-out Property; Time-dependent Travel Time",,,,,,"Garaix, T., Artigues, C., Optimization of occupancy rate in dial-a-ride problems via linear fractional column generation (2011) Computers & Operations Research, 38, pp. 1435-1442; Parragh, S.N., Introducing heterogeneous users and vehicles into models and algorithms for the dial-a-ride problem (2011) Transportation Research Part C, 19, pp. 912-930; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem (DARP): Variants, modeling issues and algorithms (2003) 4OR, 1, pp. 89-101; Ropke, S., Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., Models and branch-andcut algorithms for pickup and delivery problems with time windows (2007) Networks, 49, pp. 258-272; Hunsaker, B., Savelsbergh, M., Efficient feasibility testing for dial-a-ride problems (2002) Operations Research Letters, 30, pp. 169-173; Kong, Y., Tang, J.F., Lau, H., Andrew, W.H., IP A note on, Efficient feasibility testing for dial-a-ride problems (2010) Operations Research Letters, 38, pp. 405-407; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B, 37, pp. 579-594; Ichoua, S., Gendreau, M., Potvin, J.Y., Vehicle dispatching with time-dependent travel times (2003) Discrete Optimization, 144, pp. 379-396; Koka, A.L., Hans, E.W., Schutten, J.M.J., Optimizing departure times in vehicle routes (2011) European Journal of Operational Research, 210, pp. 579-0587; Schilde, M., Doerner, K.F., Hartl, R.F., Integrating stochastic time-dependent travel speed in solution methods for the dynamic dial-a-ride problem (2014) European Journal of Operational Research, 238, pp. 18-30",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","28th Chinese Control and Decision Conference, CCDC 2016","28 May 2016 through 30 May 2016",,123193,,9781467397148,,,"English","Proc.

In many of the presented methods to the problem a routing aspect is not considered; decision variables specify only request-to-elevator assignments and the service order of the requests is determined by applying a heuristic rule called the collective control principle. However, quality of this approach is rarely investigated. In this paper the approach is compared with a formulation defining explicitly the elevator routes. The average waiting time as well as average journey time are used as objective functions in the comparisons. Computational experiments with the former objective function on random instances arising during light and normal traffic conditions indicate that both approaches very often produce the same solution while with the latter one the situation is the opposite. Some well-known traffic patterns are also analyzed to identify cases in which the optimal solutions of these approaches are equal. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper addresses the related vehicle routing problem by using only electric vehicles (EVs) and by introducing the recharging stations (RSs). The problem is formulated as a multi-objective mixed integer linear model for minimising the total travel distance, the total cost for the EVs used and the total penalty cost for the unsatisfied time windows. In addition, length constraints on the routes are imposed in order to include several aspects such as the limited availability of the RSs. The weighted sum method is adopted and, to properly set the weights, three methods, derived from the analytical hierarchical process, are compared. Computational experiments on some instances are carried out, in order to assess the behaviour of our approach in terms of solution quality. © Copyright 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","AHP; Analytical hierarchical process; Electric vehicle routing; Multi-objective mathematical programming; Weighted sum method; WSM",,,,,,"Alvarenga, G.B., Mateus, G.R., De Tomi, G., A genetic and set partitioning two-phase approach for the vehicle routing problem with time windows (2007) Computers and Operations Research, 34 (6), pp. 1561-1584; Ambrosini, M., Caruso, T., Foresti, S., Righini, G., A GRASP for the pickup and delivery problem with rear loading (2004) Technical Report Note del Polo - Ricerca, (65). , DTI, University of Milan; Baldacci, R., Mingozzi, A., Roberti, R., Recent exact algorithms for solving the vehicle routing problem under capacity and time window constraints (2012) European Journal of Operational Research, 218 (1), pp. 1-6; Bard, F.J., Kontoravdis, G., Yu, G., A branch-and-cut procedure for the vehicle routing problem with time windows (2002) Transportation Science, 36 (2), pp. 250-269; Bent, R., Van Hentenryck, P., A two-stage hybrid algorithm for pickup and delivery vehicle routing problems with time windows (2006) Computers and Operations Research, 33 (4), pp. 875-893; Chen, H.K., Hsueh, C.F., Chang, M.S., An efficient algorithm for the time-dependent vehicle routing problem with time-windows (2002) The International Conference on Intercity Transportation, pp. 370-379. , Beijing, China, 5-7 November; Chen, X., Wan, W.S., Xu, X.H., The real-time time-dependent vehicle routing problem (2006) Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 42 (5), pp. 383-408; Cohon, J.L., (1978) Multiobjective Programming and Planning, , Acad.

This paper first proposes a new time-discretized multi-commodity network flow model for the VRPPDTW based on the integration of vehicles' carrying states within space-time transportation networks, so as to allow a joint optimization of passenger-to-vehicle assignment and turn-by-turn routing in congested transportation networks. Our three-dimensional state-space-time network construct is able to comprehensively enumerate possible transportation states at any given time along vehicle space-time paths, and further allows a forward dynamic programming solution algorithm to solve the single vehicle VRPPDTW problem. By utilizing a Lagrangian relaxation approach, the primal multi-vehicle routing problem is decomposed to a sequence of single vehicle routing sub-problems, with Lagrangian multipliers for individual passengers' requests being updated by sub-gradient-based algorithms. We further discuss a number of search space reduction strategies and test our algorithms, implemented through a specialized program in C++, on medium-scale and large-scale transportation networks, namely the Chicago sketch and Phoenix regional networks. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Forward dynamic programming; Lagrangian relaxation; Ride-sharing service optimization; Time-dependent least-cost path problem; Vehicle routing problem with pickup and delivery with time windows","C++ (programming language); Complex networks; Computer software; Lagrange multipliers; Network routing; Optimization; Pickups; Routing algorithms; Software testing; Time sharing systems; Transportation; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; LaGrangian relaxation; Large-scale transportation; Least cost path; Multi-commodity network flow models; Pick-up and delivery service; Pickup and delivery; Service optimization; Vehicle Routing Problems; Dynamic programming; algorithm; congestion; Lagrangian analysis; network analysis; optimization; transportation system",,,,,"Alfa, A.S., Scheduling of vehicles for transportation of elderly (1986) Transportation Planning and Technology, 11, pp. 203-212; Azi, N., Gendreau, M., Potvin, J.Y., An exact algorithm for a single vehicle routing problem with time windows and multiple routes (2007) European Journal of Operational Research, 178 (3), pp. 755-766; Baldacci, R., Bartolini, E., Mingozzi, A., An exact algorithm for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2011) Operations Research, 59 (2), pp. 414-426; Bell, W., Dalberto, L., Fisher, M.L., Greenfield, A., Jaikumar, R., Kedia, P., Mack, R., Prutzman, P., Improving the distribution of industrial gases with an on-line computerized routing and scheduling optimizer (1983) Interfaces, 13, pp. 4-23; Bellman, R., Dynamic programming treatment of the traveling salesman problem (1962) Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery, 9, pp. 61-63; Bodin, L.D., Sexton, T., The multi-vehicle subscriber dial-a-ride problem (1986) TIMS Studies in the Management Sciences, 22, pp. 73-86; Bramel, J., Simchi-Levi, D., A location based heuristic for general routing problems (1995) Operations Research, 43, pp. 649-660; Chabini, I., Discrete dynamic shortest path problems in transportation applications: Complexity and algorithms with optimal run time (1998) Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board, 1645, pp. 170-175; Chandra, R., Menon, R., Dagum, L., Kohr, D., Maydan, D., McDonald, J., (2000) Parallel Programming in OpenMP, , Morgan Kaufmann; Christiansen, M., Decomposition of a combined inventory routing and time constrained ship routing problem (1999) Transportation Science, 33, pp. 3-16; Cordeau, J.F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54 (3), pp. 573-586; Cullen, F., Jarvis, J., Ratliff, D., Set partitioning based heuristics for interactive routing (1981) Networks, 11, pp. 125-144; Desaulniers, G., Desrosiers, J., Erdmann, A., Solomon, M.M., Soumis, F., The VRP with pickup and delivery (2002) The Vehicle Routing Problem, SIAM Monographs on Discrete Mathematics and Applications, Chapter 9, pp. 225-242. , SIAM, Philadelphia, P.

Each stack is rear-loaded and is operated in a last-in-first-out (LIFO) fashion, meaning that when an item is picked up, it is positioned at the rear of a stack. An item can only be delivered if it is in that position. This problem arises in the transportation of heavy or dangerous material where unnecessary handling should be avoided, such as in the transportation of cars between car dealers and the transportation of livestock from farms to slaughterhouses. To solve this problem, we propose two different branch-price-and-cut algorithms. The first solves the shortest path pricing problem with the multi-stack policy, while the second incorporates this policy partly in the shortest path pricing problem and generates additional inequalities to the master problem when infeasible multi-stack routes are encountered. Computational results obtained on instances derived from benchmark instances for the pickup and delivery traveling salesman problem with multiple stacks are reported, and reveal the advantage of incorporating the multi-stack policy in the pricing problem. Instances with up to 75 requests and with one, two and three stacks can be solved optimally within 2 hours of computational time. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Both the overall job completion time and number of drivers utilized are analyzed for the automated job allocations and manual job assignments from transportation field experts. Design/methodology/approach – A nested genetic algorithm (GA) is used to automate the job allocation process and minimize the overall time to deliver all jobs, while utilizing the fewest number of drivers – as a secondary objective. Findings – Three different real world data sets were used to compare the results of the GA vs transportation field experts’ manual assignments. The job assignments from the GA improved the overall job completion time in 100 percent (30/30) of the cases and maintained the same or fewer drivers as BS Logistics (BSL) in 47 percent (14/30) of the cases. Originality/value – This paper provides a novel approach to solving a real world VRP that has multiple variants. While there have been numerous models to capture a select number of these variants, the value of this nested GA lies in its ability to incorporate multiple depots, a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles as well as varying pickup times, pickup locations, delivery times and delivery locations for each job into a single model. Existing research does not provide models to collectively address all of these variants. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Evolutionary computation; Genetic algorithms; Hard/soft time windows;

Each request consists of (i) a pickup location (origin), (ii) a delivery location (destination), and (iii) a maximum allowable travel time from the origin to the destination (maximum ride-time). The problem is to design a tour for the vehicle that (i) starts and ends at the depot, (ii) services all requests, (iii) ensures that each request's ride-time does not exceed its maximum ride-time, and (iv) minimizes the total travel time required by the vehicle to service all requests (objective function). A capacity constraint that may be present is that the weight or volume of the undelivered requests on the vehicle must always be no greater than the vehicle's capacity. In this article, we concurrently analyze the TSPPD-RT with capacity constraints and without capacity constraints. We describe two mathematical formulations of the problem. These formulations are used to derive new lower bounds on the solution to the problem. Then, we provide two exact methods for finding the optimal route that minimizes the total travel cost. Our extensive computational analysis on both versions of the TSPPD-RT shows that the proposed algorithms are capable of solving to optimality instances involving up to 50 requests. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","branch-and-price; cut-and-column generation; dual ascent","Integer programming; Linear programming; Pickups; Travel time; Vehicles; Branch and price; Capacity constraints; Computational analysis; Cut and column; dual ascent; Mathematical formulation; Objective functions; Vehicle's capacity; Traveling salesman problem",,,,,"Applegate, D.L., Bixby, R.E., Chvátal, V., Cook, W.J., (2007) The Traveling Salesman Problem: A Computational Study, Pinceton Series in Applied Mathematics, , Pinceton University Press, NJ, USA; Bartolini, E., Bodin, L.D., Mingozzi, A., (2015) The Traveling Salesman Problem with Pickup, Delivery and Ride-time Constraints: Detailed Computational Results, , http://sal.aalto.fi/en/personnel/enrico.bartolini/, Technical report, Department of Mathematics and Systems Analysis, Aalto University School of Science, Finland; Borndörfer, R., Klostermeier, F., Grötschel, M., Küttner, C., (1997) Telebus Berlin: Vehicle Scheduling in a Dial-a-ride System, , Technical Report SC 9723, Konrad-Zuse-Zentrum für Informationstechnik, Berlin; Cordeau, J.-F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Oper Res, 54, pp. 573-586; Desrosiers, J., Dumas, Y., Soumis, F., A dynamic programming solution of the large-scale single vehicle dial-a-ride problem with time windows (1986) Am J Math Manage Sci, 6, pp. 301-325; Dumitrescu, I., Røpke, S., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The traveling salesman problem with pickup and delivery (2010) Math Program ser A, 121, pp. 269-305; IBM ILOG, (2009) IBM ILOG CPLEX V12.1 User's Manual for CPLEX, , IBM Corporation; Madsen, O.B.G., Ravn, H.F., Rygaard, J.M., A heuristic algorithm for the a dial-a-ride problem with time windows, multiple capacities, and multiple objectives (1995) Ann Oper Res, 60, pp. 193-208; Niskanen, S., Östergård, P.R.J., (2003) Cliquer User's Guide, Version 1.0, , Technical Report, Communications Laboratory, Helsinki University of Technology, Espoo, Finland; Psaraftis, H.N., A dynamic programming solution to the single vehicle many-to-many immediate request dial-a-ride problem (1980) Transp Sci, 14, pp. 130-154; Psaraftis, H.N., An exact algorithm for the single vehicle many-to-many dial-a-ride problem with time windows (1983) Transp Sci, 17, pp. 351-357; Renaud, J., Boctor, F.F., Laporte, G., Pertubation heuristics for the pickup and delivery traveling salesman problem (2002) Comput Oper Res, 29, pp. 1129-1141; Røpke, S., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Models and branch-and-cut algorithms for pickup and delivery problems with time windows (2007) Networks, 49, pp. 258-272; Røpke, S., Pisinger, D., An adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2006) Transp Sci, 40, pp. 455-472; Ruland, K.S., Rodin, E.Y., The pickup and delivery problem: Faces and branch-and-cut algorithm (1997) Comp Math Appl ser A, 33, pp. 1-13; Sexton, T., Bodin, L.D., Optimizing single vehicle many-to-many operations with desired delivery times: I.

Applications of the PDPLC arise in healthcare transportation where the objective function is customer-centric or service-based. In the branch-and-price algorithm, we devise an ad hoc label-setting algorithm to solve the pricing problem and employ the bounded bidirectional search strategy to accelerate the label-setting algorithm. The proposed algorithms were tested on a set of instances generated by a common data generator in the literature. The computational results showed that the branch-and-price algorithm outperformed the branch-and-cut algorithm by a large margin, and can solve instances with 40 requests to optimality in a reasonable time frame. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Branch-and-cut;

This kind of transportation is quickly becoming an essential service for modern public mobility or logistics providers. In the DARP, a set of transportation requests has to be handled by a fleet of vehicles. Each request corresponds to a client to be transported from a pickup point to a delivery point. The routing costs have to be minimized, while respecting a set of constraints including time windows on nodes, maximum riding time per client and a maximal total duration of trips. An Evolutionary Local Search (ELS) based approach is proposed to solve this problem. A new greedy randomized heuristic to compute initial solutions is developed. A dynamic probabilities management mechanism is used in the local search to improve the convergence. The method is benchmarked on a classic set of instances from the literature and it is compared against state of the art methods. The numerical results show the effectiveness of this approach. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, ride time and customer waiting time are modeled through both constraints and an associated penalty in the objective function. We develop a column generation approach, dynamically generating feasible vehicle routes. Handling ride time constraints explicitly in the pricing problem solver requires specific developments. Our dynamic programming approach for pricing problem makes use of a heuristic dominance rule and a heuristic enumeration procedure, which in turns implies that our overall branch- And-price procedure is a heuristic. However, in practice our heuristic solutions are experimentally very close to exact solutions and our approach is numerically competitive in terms of computation times.","Column generation; Dynamic programming; Static dial- A-ride problem","Costs; Information systems; Integer programming; Linear programming; Supply chains; Branch and price; Column generation; Column generation approach; Dial-a-ride problem; Heuristic solutions; Objective functions; Pickup and delivery problem with time windows; Pricing problems; Dynamic programming",,,,,"Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The dial- A-ride problem: Models and algorithms (2007) Annals of Operations Research, 153, pp. 29-46; Cordeau, J.-F., A branch- And-cut algorithm for the dial- A-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54, pp. 573-586; Ropke, S., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Models and branch- And-cut algorithms for pickup and delivery problems with time windows (2007) Networks, 49, pp. 258-272; Parragh, S.N., Introducing heterogeneous users and vehicles into models and algorithms for the dial- A-ride problem (2011) Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 19, pp. 912-930; Parragh, S., Cordeau, J.-F., Doerner, K., Hartl, R., Models and algorithms for the heterogeneous dial- A-ride problem with driver-related constraints (2012) Or Spectrum, 34, pp. 593-633; Contardo, C., Gendron, B., Cordeau, J.-F., A branch- And- cut- And-price algorithm for the capacitated location-routing problem (2011) CIRRELT; http://preshing.com/20120208/a-look-back-At-single-Threaded-cpu-performance",,,"","International Conference on Information Systems, Logistics and Supply Chain","6th International Conference on Information Systems, Logistics and Supply Chain, ILS 2016","1 June 2016 through 4 June 2016",,123124,,,,,"English","ILS - Int.

Locations provide a number of cumulative resources that are utilized by vehicles either during service (e.g., forklifts) or for the entirety of their visit (e.g., parking bays). Locations can become congested if insufficient resources are available, upon which vehicles must wait until a resource becomes available before proceeding. The problem is challenging from a computational standpoint since it incorporates the vehicle routing problem and the resource-constrained project scheduling problem. The main contribution of this paper is a branch-and-price-and-check model that uses a branch-and-price algorithm that solves the underlying vehicle routing problem, and a constraint programming subproblem that checks the feasibility of the location resource constraints, and then adds combinatorial nogood cuts to the master problem if the resource constraints are violated. Experimental results show the benefits of the branch-and-price-and-check approach.

Users place transportation requests with specified pickup and delivery locations and times. The requests have to be completed under user inconvenience considerations by a specified fleet of vehicles. In the dial-a-ride problem, the aim is to minimize the total travel times respecting the given time windows, the maximum user ride times, and the vehicle restrictions. This paper introduces a dynamic programming algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem and demonstrates its effective application in (hybrid) metaheuristic approaches. Compared to most of the works presented in literature, this approach does not make use of any (commercial) solver. We present an exact dynamic programming algorithm and a dynamic programming based metaheuristic, which restricts the considered solution space. Then, we propose a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm which integrates the dynamic programming based algorithms into a large neighborhood framework. The algorithms are tested on a given set of benchmark instances from the literature and compared to a state-of-the-art hybrid large neighborhood search approach. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Dial-a-ride problem; Dynamic programming; Large neighborhood search",,,,,,"Bellman, R., Dynamic programming treatment of the travelling salesman problem (1962) JACM, 9, pp. 61-63; Bent, R., Hentenryck, P.V., A two-stage hybrid algorithm for pickup and delivery vehicle routing problems with time windows (2006) Computers & Operations Research, 33 (4), pp. 875-893; Blum, C., Puchinger, J., Raidl, G.R., Roli, A., Hybrid metaheuristics in combinatorial optimization: A survey (2011) Applied Soft Computing, 11 (6), pp. 4135-4151; Bräysy, O., Gendreau, M., Vehicle routing problem with time windows, part II: Metaheuristics (2005) Transportation Science, 39 (1), pp. 119-139; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 37 (6), pp. 579-594; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem: Models and algorithms (2007) Annals of Operations Research, 153, pp. 29-46; Dumas, Y., Desrosiers, J., Gelinas, E., Solomon, M.M., An optimal algorithm for the traveling salesman problem with time windows (1995) Operations Research, 43 (2), pp. 367-371; Funke, B., Grünert, T., Irnich, S., Local search for vehicle routing and scheduling problems: Review and conceptual integration (2005) Journal of Heuristics, 11, pp. 267-306; Gendreau, M., Potvin, J.Y., Brumlaysy, O., Hasle, G., Løkketangen, A., Metaheuristics for the vehicle routing problem and its extensions: A categorized bibliography (2008) The vehicle routing problem: latest advances and new challenges, operations research/computer science interfaces series, pp. 143-169. , Golden B, Raghavan S, Wasil E, (eds), 43, Springer, New York; Gromicho, J.A.S., van Hoorn, J.J., Kok, A.L., Schutten, J.M.J., Restricted dynamic programming: A flexible framework for solving realistic VRPs (2012) Computers & OR, 39 (5), pp. 902-909; Gschwind, T., Irnich, S., Effective handling of dynamic time windows and synchronization with precedences for exact vehicle routing.

Users formulate requests specifying desired locations and times of pickup and delivery. Given a set of requests, the vehicle routes are to be planned and scheduled in order to minimize both the number of vehicles used and the journey durations, while respecting a set of constraints imposed by the service, the passengers and the vehicles. In a dynamic environment, requests arrive gradually along the day, and the routes must be adjusted in real time to accommodate the new demand. In this work we propose an approach that simulates a dynamic service using mixed linear programming models to produce good solutions. The obtained results for a set of instances are significative when compared to a static approach. © 2015 IEEE.","demand responsive transport; dynamic service; integer programming","Integer programming; Linear programming; Motor transportation; Transportation; Vehicles; Demand responsive transport; Dynamic approaches; Dynamic environments; Dynamic services; Mixed linear programming; Number of vehicles; Pickup and delivery; Transportation services; Fleet operations",,,,,"Crainic, T.G., Errico, F., Malucelli, F., Nonato, M., Designing the master schedule for demand-adaptive transit systems (2012) Annals of Operations Research, 194 (1), pp. 151-166; Ambrosino, G., Nelson, J., Romanazzo, M., Demand responsive transport services: Towards the flexible mobility agency (2004) ENEA, Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and the Environment; Executive, G.M.P.T., Enoch, M., Potter, S., Parkhurst, G., Smith, M., (2004) Intermode: Innovations in Demand Responsive Transport; Mageean, J., Nelson, J.D., The evaluation of demand responsive transport services in Europe (2003) Journal of Transport Geography, 11 (4), pp. 255-270; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Potvin, J.-Y., Savelsbergh, M.W., Transportation on demand (2007) Transportation, Handbooks in Operations Research and Management Science, 14, pp. 429-466; Chevrier, R., (2008) Optimisation de Transport À la Demande dans des Territoires Polarisés, , Ph.

The LIFO loading rule ensures that no handling is required prior to unloading an item from a vehicle: a linear stack loading structure is maintained and an item can only be delivered if it is the last one in the stack. Three exact branch-price-and-cut algorithms are proposed for this problem. The first incorporates the LIFO constraints in the master problem. The second one handles the LIFO constraints directly in the shortest path pricing problem. It applies a dynamic programming algorithm relying on an ad hoc dominance criterion. The third algorithm is a hybrid between the first two methods. Known valid inequalities are adapted to the PDPTWL and the impact of different path relaxations on the total computation time is investigated. Computational results obtained on instances derived from known instances of the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (PDPTW) are reported. © 2015 INFORMS.","Branch-price-and-cut; Column generation; Last-in-first-out loading; Valid inequalities; Vehicle routing with pickup and delivery","Algorithms; Costs; Crashworthiness; Dynamic programming; Linear programming; Pickups; Unloading; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Branch-price-and-cut; Column generation; Last in first outs; Pickup and delivery; Valid inequality; Loading",,,,,"Baldacci, R., Bartolini, E., Mingozzi, A., An exact algorithm for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2011) Oper.

In this paper, we focus on a common destination ridesharing system which is of interest in large organizations such as companies and government offices. Particularly, such organizations are looking at using company owned vehicles to offer a ridesharing service by which employees carpool to work thus leading to several benefits that include decreasing pressure on on-campus parking spaces, lowering localized on-campus congestion, in addition to offering a greener transportation mode while lowering transportation costs for employees. Based on discussions with our industry partners, optimizing the distribution of limited number of company vehicles while insuring robustness against unlikely vehicle unavailability is of critical importance. Thus in this paper, we present a stochastic mixed integer programming model to optimize the allocation of shared vehicles to employees while taking into account the unforeseen event of vehicle unavailability which would require some participants to take own vehicles or rerouting of existing vehicles. Since solving the proposed model to optimality is computationally challenging for problems of large sizes, we also propose a heuristic that is capable of finding good quality solutions in limited computational time. The proposed model and heuristic are tested on several instances of varying sizes showing the computational performance. Finally, a test case based on the city of Rome, Italy is presented and insights related to vehicle distribution and travel time savings are discussed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Car placement; Integer programming; Ridesharing","Amphibious vehicles; Optimization; Stochastic models; Traffic congestion; Transportation; Travel time; Vehicles; Car placement; Computational performance; Public transportation; Ride-sharing; Stochastic mixed integer programming; Stochastic optimization approach; Transportation cost; Travel time savings; Integer programming; car ownership; linear programing; numerical model; public transport; stochasticity; transportation planning; travel demand; travel time; Italy; Lazio; Roma [Lazio]; Rome",,,,,"Achterberg, T., Berthold, T., Improving the feasibility pump (2007) Discrete Optimization, 4 (1), pp. 77-86; Agatz, N., Erera, A., Savelsbergh, M., Wang, X., Dynamic ride-sharing: a simulation study in metro Atlanta (2011) Transportation Research Part B, 45, pp. 1450-1464; Agatz, N., Erera, A., Savelsbergh, M., Wang, X., Optimization for dynamic ride-sharing: a review (2012) European Journal of Operational Research, 223 (2), pp. 295-303; Attanasio, A., Cordeau, J.-F., Ghiani, G., Laporte, G., Parallel tabu search heuristics for the dynamic multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2004) Parallel Computing, 30 (3), pp. 377-387; Baldacci, R., Maniezzo, V., Mingozzi, A., An exact method for the car pooling problem based on Lagrangean column generation (2004) Operations Research, 52 (3), pp. 422-439; Clarke, G., Wright, J., Scheduling of vehicles from a central depot to a number of delivery points (1964) Operations Research, 12 (4), pp. 568-581; Cordeau, J.-F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54 (3), pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B, 37 (6), pp. 579-594; Desaulniers, G., Desrosiers, J., Erdmann, A., Solomon, M.M., Soumis, F., VRP with pickup and delivery (2001) The Vehicle Routing Problem, pp. 225-242. , SIAM, Philadelphia, PA, P.

We model the problem as a multi-trip dial-a-ride problem (MTDARP), which requires designing several routes for each ambulance. A route is a sequence of locations, starting and terminating at the depot (hospital), according to which the ambulance picks up clients at the origins and delivers them to the destinations. A route is feasible only if it satisfies a series of side constraints, such as the pair and precedence constraints, capacity limit, ride time, route duration limit and time windows. Owing to the route duration limit, in particular, every ambulance is scheduled to operate several routes during the working period. To prevent the spread of disease, the interior of the ambulances needs to be disinfected at the depot between two consecutive trips. The primary aim of the problem investigated herein is to service more requests with the given resources, and to minimize the total travel cost for the same number of requests. In this paper, we provide a mathematical formulation for the problem and develop a memetic algorithm with a customized recombination operator. Moreover, the segment-based evaluation method is adapted to examine the moves quickly. The performance of the proposed algorithm is assessed using the real-world data from 2009 and compared with results obtained by solving the mathematical model. In addition, the proposed algorithm is adapted to solve the classic DARP instances, and found to perform well on medium-scale instances.

The fleet is assumed to be heterogeneous with a novel feature that allows the vehicles to be configured before service begins to handle various types of demand. The work was motivated by a daily route planning problem arising at a senior activity center. A fleet of configurable vans is available each day to transport participants to and from the center, as well as to secondary facilities for rehabilitative and medical treatment. The number of participants and support equipment that a van can accommodate depends on how it is configured. An exact method is introduced based on branch and price and cut. At each node in the search tree, the master problem is solved by column generation to find a lower bound. To improve the bound, subset-row inequalities are applied to the variables of the master problem. Columns are generated by solving the pricing subproblems with a labeling algorithm enhanced by new dominance conditions. Local search on the current set of columns is used to quickly find promising additions. Implementation details and ways to improve the performance of the overall procedure are discussed. Testing was done on a set of real instances as well as a set of randomly generated instances with up to 50 customer requests. The results show that optimal solutions are obtained in the majority of cases. © 2015 INFORMS.","Branch and price and cut; Configurable vehicle capacity; Dial-a-ride problem; Heterogeneous vehicles; Pickup and delivery problem","Algorithms; Cabs (truck); Costs; Fleet operations; Linear programming; Pickups; Trucks; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Branch-and-price-and-cut; Dial-a-ride problem; Heterogeneous vehicles; Pickup and delivery problems; Vehicle capacity; Integer programming",,,,,"Alexandrescu, A., (2001) Modern CCC Design: Generic Programming and Design Patterns Applied, , Addison-Wesley, Boston; Baldacci, R., Bartolini, E., Mingozzi, A., An exact algorithm for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2011) Oper.

The most prevalent context of dynamic time windows is when precedence is given for the two operations so that it is a priori specified that one operation must take place before the other. A prominent vehicle routing problem with dynamic time windows and precedence is the dial-a-ride problem (DARP), where user-specified transportation requests from origin to destination points must be serviced. The paper presents a new branch-and-cut-and-price solution approach for the DARP, the prototypical vehicle-routing problem with ordinary and dynamic time windows. For the first time (to our knowledge), both ordinary and dynamic time windows are handled in the column-generation subproblem. For the solution, an effective column-generation pricing procedure is derived that allows fast shortest-path computations due to new dominance rules. The new approach is compared with alternative column-generation algorithms that handle dynamic time windows either as constraints of the master program or with less effective labeling procedures. Computational experiments indicate the superiority of the new approach. © 2015 INFORMS.","Branch-and-price; Dial-a-ride problem; Dynamic time windows; Labeling algorithm; Ride-time constraints; Time synchronization; Transportation; Vehicle routing","Costs; Integer programming; Linear programming; Network routing; Routing algorithms; Transportation; Vehicles; Branch and price; Dial-a-ride problem; Dynamic time; Labeling algorithms; Time constraints; Time synchronization; Vehicle routing",,,,,"Ascheuer, N., Fischetti, M., Grötschel, M., A polyhedral study of the asymmetric traveling salesman problem with time windows (2000) Networks, 36 (2), pp. 69-79; Azi, N., Gendreau, M., Potvin, J.-Y., An exact algorithm for a vehicle routing problem with time windows and multiple use of vehicles (2010) Eur.

The task is to find a set of minimum-cost routes satisfying pairing and precedence, capacities, and time windows. Additionally, temporal synchronization constraints couple the service times at the pickup and delivery locations of the customer requests in the following way: a request has to be delivered within prespecified minimum and maximum time lags (called ride times) after it has been picked up. The presence of these ride-time constraints severely complicates the subproblem of the natural column-generation formulation of the SPDP so that it is not clear if their integration into the subproblem pays off in an integer column-generation approach. Therefore, we develop four branch-and-cut-and-price algorithms for the SPDP based on column-generation formulations that use different subproblems. Two of these subproblems are considered for the first time in this paper have not been studied before. We derive new dominance rules and labeling algorithms for their effective solution. Extensive computational results indicate that integrating either both types of ride-time constraints or only the maximum ride-time constraints into the subproblem results in the strongest overall approach. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Association of European Operational Research Societies (EURO) withinthe International Federation of Operational Research Societies (IFORS).

Although Dial-a-ride Problems (DARP) have been discussed for several decades, most researchers have worked to develop algorithms with low computational cost under the minimal total travel costs, and fewer studies have considered how changes in travel time might affect the vehicle routes and service sequences. Ignoring such variations in travel time when design vehicle routes and schedules might lead to the production of inefficient vehicle routes, as well as incorrect actual vehicle arrival times at the related nodes. The purpose of this paper is to construct a DARP formulation with consideration of time-dependent travel times and utilizes the traffic simulation software, DynaTAIWAN, to simulate the real traffic conditions in order to obtain the time-dependent travel time matrices. The branch-and-price approach is introduced for the time-dependent DARP and tested by examining the sub-network of Kaohsiung City, Taiwan. The numerical results reveal that the length of the time window can significantly affect the vehicle routes and quantitative measurements. As the length of the time window increases, the objective value and the number of vehicles will reduce significantly. However, the CPU time, the average pickup delay time, the average delivery delay time and the average actual ride time (ART)/direct ride time (DRT) will increase significantly as the length of the time window increases. Designing the vehicle routes to reduce operating costs and satisfy the requirements of customers is a difficult task, and a trade-off must be made between these goals.

Sharing taxis which has been prominent in several developing countries is also becoming common in several cities around the world. Sharing taxis presents several advantages as it minimizes vacant seats in cars thus reducing costs on taxi operators which results in significantly lower taxi fares for passengers. Besides the economical advantages, taxi sharing is highly important for reducing congestion on the roads and for minimizing the impact of transportation on the environment. In this paper, we formulate the problem of assigning passengers to taxis and computing the optimal routes of taxis as a mixed integer program. To solve the proposed model, we present a Lagrangian decomposition approach which exploits the structure of the problem leading to smaller problems that are solved separately. Furthermore, we propose two heuristics that are used to obtain good quality feasible solutions. The Lagrangian approach along with the heuristics are implemented and compared to solving the full problem using CPLEX. The computational results indicate the efficiency of the methodology in providing tighter bounds than CPLEX in shorter computational time. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Integer programming; Lagrangian relaxation;

Demand Responsive Transport systems (DRT) that provide a share transportation services with flexible routes and focus on optimizing of economic and environmental value are becoming an important part of public transportation. In this paper we propose a new approach to design of DRT models which considers DRT as a multi-agent system (MAS) where various autonomous agents represent interests of system's stakeholders. The distributed nature of the MAS facilitates design of scalable implementations in modern cloud environments. We also propose a planning algorithm based on combinatorial auctions (CA) that allows to express commodity of multiple transportation scenarios by evident means of the bids. Using the mechanism of CA we may fully take into account the presence of complementariness and substitutability among the items that differ across bidders. Further, we describe design principles of our proposed software with a prototype implementation. We believe that our approach to multi-agent modeling is general enough to provide the flexibility necessary for adoption of DRT-services modeling into real-world scenarios. The results of modeling have been compared against several cases of a local bus provider and validated in a set of computational experiments. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

All of these features originate from practical applications in recent years. To formulate the problem, we propose two mathematical models that use different methods to deal with requests associated with the depot. To further strengthen the models, we propose eight families of valid inequalities, and based on them, we propose a branch-and-cut algorithm to solve the problem. The branch-and-cut algorithm was extensively tested on a set of instances generated according to the data of a real world application. The computational results showed that seven families of inequalities can improve the lower bounds substantially and the branch-and-cut algorithm can solve instances with up to 22 requests within 4 h. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Branch-and-cut;

This paper proposes a two-phase mathematical programming model to formulate the liner hub-and-spoke shipping network design problem subject to the maritime cabotage legislations, i.e., the hub location and feeder allocation problem for phase I and the ship route design with ship fleet deployment problem for phase II. The problem in phase I is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming model. By developing a hub port expanding technique, the problem in phase II is formulated as a vehicle routing problem with pickup and delivery. A Lagrangian relaxation based solution method is proposed to solve it.

However, most carpooling organizations currently use a trial-and-error process, in accordance with the projected vehicle travel times, for carpooling, which is neither effective nor efficient. In other words, stochastic disturbances arising from variations in vehicle travel times in actual operations are neglected. In the worst case scenario, where vehicle travel times fluctuate wildly during operations, the planned schedule could be disturbed enough to lose its optimality. Therefore, we constructed a stochastic carpooling model that considers the influence of stochastic travel times. The model is formulated as an integer multiple commodity network flow problem. Since real problem sizes can be large, it could be difficult to find optimal solutions within a reasonable period of time. Therefore, we develop a solution algorithm to solve the model. To test how well the model and the solution algorithm can be applied to the real world, we also developed a simulation-based evaluation method. To test the model and the solution algorithm, a case study is performed based upon data reported from a past study carried out in northern Taiwan. The results show that the model and solution algorithm are good and could be useful for carpooling practices. © 2013 IEEE.","Carpooling; multiple commodity network flow problem; stochastic travel time; time-space network",,,,,,"Ferrari, E., Manzini, R., Pareschi, A., Persona, A., Regattieri, A., The car pooling problem: Heuristic algorithms based on savings functions (2003) J.

A parallel insertion heuristic based on the spatial and temporal aspects is presented. The proposed algorithm firstly sorts the requests based on the earliest pickup time and decentralization index alternately and initializes the routes with seed requests. Then a insertion-rejected-reinsertion operation is performed, in which the spatial aspect as the granular is also considered. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm reduces costs effectively, compared with the algorithms only considering the temporal aspect and no seed requests. Also, sensitivity analysis indicates that the required vehicle number is insensitive to the granular extent and the initial vehicle number. © 2014 IEEE.","Dial-A-Ride Problem; Parallel Insertion Algorithm; Rejected-Reinsertion; Spatio-Temporal","Control; Dial-a-ride problem; Insertion algorithms; Rejected-Reinsertion; Service Quality; Spatio-temporal; Temporal aspects; Time constraints; Vehicle numbers; Algorithms",,,,,"Garaix, T., Artigues, C., Optimization of occupancy rate in dial-A-ride problems via linear fractional column genera-tion (2011) Computers &Operations Research, 38, pp. 1435-1442; Parragh, S.N., Introducing heterogeneous users and vehicles into models and algorithms for the dial-A-ride problem (2011) Transportation Research Part C, 19, pp. 912-930; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., The dial-A-ride problem (DARP): Variants (2003) Modeling Issues and algorithms4OR, 1, pp. 89-101; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., The dial-A-ride problem: Models and algorithms (2007) Annals of Operations Research, 153 (1), pp. 29-46; Ropke, S., Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., Models and branch-andcut algorithms for pickup and delivery problems with time windows (2007) Networks, 49, pp. 258-272; Kong, Y., Tang, J.F., Pan, Z.D., Dong, G., A set partition based heuristic algorithm to solve the problem of pickup and delivery of air-passengers (2009) Journal of Northeastern University: Natural Science, 30 (5), pp. 625-627; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-A-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B, 37, pp. 579-594; Diana, M., Dessouky, M.M., A new regret insertion heuristic for solving large-scale dial-A-ride problems with time windows (2004) Transportation Research Part B, 38 (6), pp. 539-557; Luo, Y., Paul, S., A rejected-reinsertion heuristic for the static dial-A-ride problem (2007) Transportation Research Part B, 41, pp. 736-755",,,"","IEEE Computer Society","26th Chinese Control and Decision Conference, CCDC 2014","31 May 2014 through 2 June 2014","Changsha",106637,,9781479937066,,,"English","Chin.

Determining the optimal route for a vehicle to satisfy transport requests while minimizing the total cost refers to the Single Vehicle Pickup and Delivery Problem. Beside time and distance objectives, in real world operations it is mandatory to consider further constraints such as time windows and the capacity of the vehicle. This paper presents a novel approach to solve Single Vehicle Pickup and Delivery Problems with time windows and capacity constraints by applying Nested Monte-Carlo Search (NMCS). NMCS is a randomized exploration technique which has successfully solved complex combinatorial search problems. To evaluate the approach, we apply benchmarks instances with up to 400 cities which have to be visited. The effects of varying the number of iterations and the search level are investigated. The results reveal, that the algorithm computes state-of-the-art solutions and is competitive with other approaches.","Nested Monte-Carlo search; Routing and scheduling problems; Single Vehicle Pickup and Delivery Problem (PDP); Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)","Artificial intelligence; Scheduling; Traveling salesman problem; Capacity constraints; Exploration techniques; Nested monte-carlo; Number of iterations; Pickup and delivery problems; Pickup and delivery problems with time windows; Real world operations; Routing and scheduling; Vehicle routing",,,,,"Applegate, D.L., Bixby, R.E., Chvatal, V., Cook, W.J., (2011) The Traveling Salesman Problem: A Computational Study, , Princeton University Press; Bent, R., Hentenryck, P.V., A two-stage hybrid algorithm for pickup and delivery vehicle routing problems with time windows (2006) Computers &operations Research, 33 (4), pp. 875-893; Bjarnason, R., Fern, A., Tadepalli, P., Lower bounding klondike solitaire with monte-carlo planning (2009) ICAPS; Browne, C.B., Powley, E., Whitehouse, D., Lucas, S.M., Cowling, P.I., Rohlfshagen, P., Tavener, S., Colton, S., A survey of monte carlo tree search methods (2012) Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, IEEE Transactions on, 4 (1), pp. 1-43; Cazenave, T., Nested monte-carlo search (2009) IJCAI, pp. 456-461; Cazenave, T., Teytaud, F., Application of the nested rollout policy adaptation algorithm to the traveling salesman problem with time windows (2012) LION, pp. 42-54; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-A-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 37 (6), pp. 579-594; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The Dial-A-Ride Problem (DARP): Variants, modeling issues and algorithms (2003) Quarterly Journal of the Belgian, French and Italian Operations Research Societies, 1 (2), pp. 89-101; Edelkamp, S., Gath, M., Cazenave, T., Teytaud, F., Algorithm and knowledge engineering for the TSPTW problem (2013) IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI); Een, N., Mishchenko, A., Sorensson, N., Applying logic synthesis for speeding up sat (2007) Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing-SAT 2007, pp. 272-286. , Springer; Gajpal, Y., Abad, P., An ant colony system (acs) for vehicle routing problem with simultaneous delivery and pickup (2009) Computers &operations Research, 36 (12), pp. 3215-3223; Gendreau, M., Laporte, G., Vigo, D., Heuristics for the traveling salesman problem with pickup and delivery (1999) Computers &operations Research, 26 (7), pp. 699-714; Hernandez-Perez, H., Salazar-Gonzalez, J.-J., A branch-And-cut algorithm for a traveling salesman problem with pickup and delivery (2004) Discrete Applied Mathematics, 145 (1), pp. 126-139; Hosny, M.I., Mumford, C.L., Single vehicle pickup and delivery with time windows: Made to measure genetic encoding and operators (2007) Proceedings of the 2007 GECCO Conference Companion on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation, pp. 2489-2496. , ACM; Hosny, M.I., Mumford, C.L., The single vehicle pickup and delivery problem with time windows: Intelligent operators for heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms (2010) Journal of Heuristics, 16 (3), pp. 417-439; Jih, W.-R., Hsu, Y., A family competition genetic algorithm for the pickup and delivery problems with time window (2004) Bulletin of the College of Engineering, 90, pp. 121-130; Landrieu, A., Mati, Y., Binder, Z., A tabu search heuristic for the single vehicle pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2001) Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, 12 (5-6), pp. 497-508; Luby, M., Sinclair, A., Zuckerman, D., Optimal speedup of las vegas algorithms (1993) Information Processing Letters, 47 (4), pp. 173-180; Pankratz, G., A grouping genetic algorithm for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2005) OR Spectrum, 27 (1), pp. 21-41; Parragh, S.N., Doerner, K.F., Hartl, R.F., A survey on pickup and delivery problems part ii: Transportation between pickup and delivery locations (2008) Journal fur Betriebswirtschaft, 58 (2), pp. 81-117; Psaraftis, H.N., An exact algorithm for the single vehicle many-to-many dial-A-ride problem with time windows (1983) Transportation Science, 17 (3), pp. 351-357; Ropke, S., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Models and branch-And-cut algorithms for pickup and delivery problems with time windows (2007) Networks, 49 (4), pp. 258-272; Rosin, C.D., Nested rollout policy adaptation for monte carlo tree search (2011) IJCAI, pp. 649-654. , AAAI Press; Solomon, M.M., Algorithms for the vehicle routing and scheduling problems with time window constraints (1987) Operations Research, 35 (2), pp. 254-265; Srour, F.J., Van De Velde, S., Are stacker crane problems easy?

We address the PDP with Transfers (PDP-T), in which vehicles plan to transfer items between one another to form more efficient schedules. We introduce the Very Large Neighborhood Search with Transfers (VLNS-T) algorithm to form schedules for the PDP-T. Our approach allows multiple transfers for items at arbitrary locations, and is not restricted to a set of predefined transfer points. We show that VLNS-T improves upon the best known PDP solutions for benchmark problems, and demonstrate its effectiveness on problems sampled from real world taxi data in New York City.

Users may change vehicles during their trip. This change of vehicle, called a transfer, is made at specific locations called transfer points. Solving the DARPT involves modeling and algorithmic difficulties. In this paper we provide a solution method based on an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) metaheuristic and explain how to check the feasibility of a request insertion. The method is evaluated on real-life and generated instances.

On the other hand, to increase their competitiveness on the market, companies are asked to consider preferences of the customers as well. Therefore, tools for logistics management need to manage collective resources, as many depots and heterogeneous fleets, providing flexible preference handling at the same time. In this paper we tackle a pickup and delivery vehicle routing problem involving such aspects; customers place preferences on visiting time (represented as soft time windows), and their violation is allowed at a price. Our interest in this problem stems from an ongoing industrial project. First we propose an exact branch-and-price algorithm, having as a core advanced dynamic programming techniques. Then we analyze through a computational campaign the impact of soft time windows management on the optimal solution in terms of both routing and overall distribution costs. Our experiments show that our approach can solve instances of real size, and clarify the practical usefulness of soft time windows management. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg and Mathematical Optimization Society 2013.",,"Algorithms; Costs; Dynamic programming; Branch-and-price algorithms; Cost of transportation; Heterogeneous fleet; Industrial projects; Logistics management; Pickup and delivery; Pickup and delivery problems; Transportation enterprise; Integer programming",,,,,"Achterberg, T., (2007) Constraint Integer Programming., , PhD thesis, Technische Universität Berlin; Balakrishnan, N., Simple heuristics for the vehicle routing problem with soft time windows (1993) J.

Delivery and pick up requests may be served in an arbitrary (mixed) order. We refer to this problem as the dynamic vehicle routing problem with mixed backhauls (DVRPMB). We address DVRPMB through iterative reoptimization. In addition to defining the reoptimization model, we drill down to significant aspects concerning the reoptimization process; that is, (i) how to reoptimize, (ii) when to reoptimize, and (iii) what part of the new plan to communicate to the drivers. On some of these aspects, we establish theoretical insights. To solve the reoptimization problem, we propose a branch-and-price approach and a novel insertion heuristic which is based on column generation and provides near optimal solutions in an efficient manner. We use extensive experimentation to test the proposed methods and analyze the related reoptimization policies. Based on the results obtained, we propose reoptimization guidelines under various operational settings. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Branch-and-price; Dynamic pickup-and-delivery; Dynamic vehicle routing; Reoptimization","Integer programming; Iterative methods; Linear programming; Network routing; Pickups; Routing algorithms; Vehicle routing; Branch and price; Column generation; Dynamic routing; Dynamic Vehicle Routing; Dynamic vehicle routing problems; Near-optimal solutions; Pickup and delivery; Reoptimization; Problem solving",,,,,"Angelelli, E., Bianchessi, N., Mansini, R., Speranza, M.G., Short term strategies for a dynamic multi-period routing problem (2009) Transp Res Part C, 17, pp. 106-119; Athanasopoulos, T., Minis, I., Efficient techniques for the multi-period vehicle routing problem with time windows within a branch and price framework (2013) Ann Oper Res, 206, pp. 1-22; Barnhart, C., Johnson, E.L., Nemhauser, G.L., Savelsbergh, M.W.P., Vance, P.H., Branch-and-price: Column generation for solving huge integer programs (1998) Oper Res, 46, pp. 316-329; Bent, R.W., Van Hentenryck, P., Scenario-based planning for partially dynamic vehicle routing with stochastic customers (2004) Oper Res, 52, pp. 977-987; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Gribkovskaia, I., Laporte, G., Static pickup and delivery problems: A classification scheme and survey (2007) TOP, 15, pp. 1-31; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Dynamic pickup and delivery problems (2010) Eur J Oper Res, 202, pp. 8-15; Branke, J., Middendorf, M., Noeth, M., Dessouky, M., Waiting strategies for dynamic vehicle routing (2005) Transp Sci, 29, pp. 298-312; Chabrier, A., Vehicle routing problem with elementary shortest path based column generation (2006) Comput Oper Res, 33, pp. 2972-2990; Chang, M.S., Chen, S.R., Hsueh, C.F., Real-time vehicle routing problem with time windows and simultaneous delivery/pickup demands (2003) J Eastern Asia Soc Transp Stud, 5, pp. 2273-2286; Chen, Z.L., Xu, H., Dynamic column generation for dynamic vehicle routing with time windows (2006) Transp Sci, 40, pp. 74-88; Christofides, N., Mingozzi, A., Toth, P., The vehicle routing problem (1979) Combinatorial Optimization, pp. 315-339. , N.

Some features of this problem have been studied in the literature as the stacker crane problem (SCP). However, the scope of most literature (including SCP) is restricted to minimizing the route or distance traveled by cranes and the resulting movement-related costs. In practice, cargo containers are generally stacked or piled up in multiple separate columns, heaps or stacks at ports. So, the cranes need to often rearrange or shuffle such container stacks, in order to pick up any required container. If substantial re-stacking is involved, cranes expend considerable effort in container stack rearrangement operations. The problem of minimizing the total efforts/time of the crane must therefore account for both - the stack rearrangement costs and also the movement-related (route distance) costs. The consolidated problem differs from standard route distance minimization situations if stack rearrangement activities are considered. We formally define the consolidated problem, identify its characteristic features and hence devise suitable models for it. We formulate several alternative MIP approaches to solve the problem. We compare the performance of our MIP formulations and analyze their suitability for various possible situations. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Combinatorial optimization; Container stacking; Crane scheduling; Mixed integer program; Stacker crane problem","Combinatorial optimization; Containers; Costs; Cranes; Integer programming; Optimization; Scheduling; Cargo containers; Container stacking problems; Container stacks; Crane scheduling; Distance minimizations; Mixed-integer programs; Optimization problems; Stacker crane problems; Problem solving",,,,,"Aslidis, A., (1989) Combinatorial Algorithms for Stacking Problems, , [Ph.D. thesis].

In real-life this operational planning problem is often complicated by several factors. Users may have special requirements (e.g. to be transported in a wheelchair) while service providers operate a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles from multiple depots in their service area. In this paper, a general dial-a-ride problem in which these three real-life aspects may simultaneously be taken into account is introduced: the Multi-Depot Heterogeneous Dial-A-Ride Problem (MD-H-DARP). Both a three- and two-index formulation are discussed. A branch-and-cut algorithm for the standard dial-a-ride problem is adapted to exactly solve small problem instances of the MD-H-DARP. To be able to solve larger problem instances, a new deterministic annealing meta-heuristic is proposed. Extensive numerical experiments are presented on different sets of benchmark instances for the homogeneous and the heterogeneous single depot dial-a-ride problem. Instances for the MD-H-DARP are introduced as well. The branch-and-cut algorithm provides considerably better results than an existing algorithm which uses a less compact formulation. All seven previously unsolved benchmark instances for the heterogeneous dial-a-ride problem could be solved to optimality within a matter of seconds. While computation times of the exact algorithm increase drastically with problem size, the proposed meta-heuristic algorithm provides near-optimal solutions within limited computation time for all instances. Several best known solutions for unsolved instances are improved and the algorithm clearly outperforms current state-of-the-art heuristics for the homogeneous and heterogeneous dial-a-ride problem, both in terms of solution quality and computation time. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Branch-and-cut algorithm; Demand responsive transportation; Deterministic annealing meta-heuristic; Dial-a-ride; Heterogeneous users and vehicles; Vehicle routing","Benchmarking; Fleet operations; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Integer programming; Optimization; Rapid thermal annealing; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Branch-and-cut algorithms; Deterministic annealing; Dial-a-Ride; Heterogeneous users; Meta heuristic algorithm; Meta-heuristic approach; Metaheuristic; Near-optimal solutions; Problem solving; algorithm; design; heuristics; numerical method; transport vehicle",,,,,"Ascheuer, N., Fischetti, M., Grotschel, M., A polyhedral study of the asymmetric traveling salesman problem with time windows (2000) Networks, 36 (2), pp. 69-79; Atahran, A., Lenté, C., T'kindt, V., (2014), doi:10.1002/mcda.1518, A multicriteria dial-a-ride problem with an ecological measure and heterogeneous vehicles.

It extends the classical Periodic Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (PVRPTW) to three types of demands of patients at home. Demands include transportation of drugs/medical devices between the HHC depot and patients[U+05F3] homes, delivery of special drugs from the hospital to patients, and delivery of blood samples from patients to the lab. Each patient requires a certain number of visits within a planning horizon and has a set of possible combinations of visit days. Daily routing should meet time window constraints associated with patients, the hospital and the lab. The problem consists in determining the visit days of each patient and vehicle routes for each day in order to minimize the maximal routing costs among all routes over the horizon. We propose a Tabu Search method combined with different local search schemes including both feasible and infeasible local searches. The proposed approaches are tested on a range of instances derived from existing Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Window (VRPTW) benchmarks and benchmarks on special cases of our problem. Numerical results show that local search scheme starting with an infeasible local search with a small probability followed by a feasible local search with high probability is an interesting hybridization. Experiments with field data from a HHC company show that the proposed approach reduces the total cost and better balances the workloads of vehicles. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Feasible local search; Home health care; Infeasible local search; Periodic vehicle routing; Tabu search",,,,,,"Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., Mercier, A., A unified tabu search heuristic for vehicle routing problems with time windows (2001) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 52, pp. 928-936; Bektas, T., The multiple traveling salesman problem: an overview of formulations and solution procedures (2006) Omega, 34, pp. 209-219; Carter, A.E., Ragsdale, C.T., Scheduling pre-printed newspaper advertising inserts using genetic algorithms (2002) Omega, 30, pp. 415-421; Gendreau, M., Hertz, A., Laporte, G., Stan, M.A., Generalized insertion heuristic for the traveling salesman problem with time windows (1998) Operations Research, 46, pp. 330-335; Savelsbergh, M.W.P., Local search in routing problems with time windows (1985) Annals of Operations Research, 4, pp. 285-305; Cordeau, J.F., Gendreau, M., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for periodic and multi-depot vehicle routing problems (1997) Networks, 30, pp. 105-119; Begur, S.V., Miller, D.M., Weaver, J.R., An integrated spatial DSS for scheduling and routing home-health-care nurses (1997) Interfaces, 27, pp. 35-48; Cheng, E., Rich, J.L., (1998) A Home Health Care Routing and Scheduling Problem.

The traditional objective of distribution management has been upgraded to minimizing system-wide costs related to economic and environmental issues. Reflecting the environmental sensitivity of vehicle routing problems (VRP), an extensive literature review of Green Vehicle Routing Problems (GVRP) is presented. We provide a classification of GVRP that categorizes GVRP into Green-VRP, Pollution Routing Problem, VRP in Reverse Logistics, and suggest research gaps between its state and richer models describing the complexity in real-world cases. The purpose is to review the most up-to-date state-of-the-art of GVRP, discuss how the traditional VRP variants can interact with GVRP and offer an insight into the next wave of research into GVRP. It is hoped that OR/MS researchers together with logistics practitioners can be inspired and cooperate to contribute to a sustainable industry. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The variants thus formed are supported by a well-developed literature, including a large variety of heuristics. This article first reviews the main classes of attributes, providing a survey of heuristics and meta-heuristics for Multi-Attribute Vehicle Routing Problems (MAVRP). It then takes a closer look at the concepts of 64 remarkable meta-heuristics, selected objectively for their outstanding performance on 15 classic MAVRP with different attributes. This cross-analysis leads to the identification of ""winning strategies"" in designing effective heuristics for MAVRP. This is an important step in the development of general and efficient solution methods for dealing with the large range of vehicle routing variants. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It concerns the delivery of drugs and medical devices from the home care company's pharmacy to patients' homes, delivery of special drugs from a hospital to patients, pickup of bio samples and unused drugs and medical devices from patients. The problem can be considered as a special vehicle routing problem with simultaneous delivery and pickup and time windows, with four types of demands: delivery from depot to patient, delivery from a hospital to patient, pickup from a patient to depot and pickup from a patient to a medical lab. Each patient is visited by one vehicle and each vehicle visits each node at most once. Patients are associated with time windows and vehicles with capacity. Two mixed-integer programming models are proposed. We then propose a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and a Tabu Search (TS) method. The GA is based on a permutation chromosome, a split procedure and local search. The TS is based on route assignment attributes of patients, an augmented cost function, route re-optimization, and attribute-based aspiration levels. These approaches are tested on test instances derived from existing VRPTW benchmarks. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Each customer must be visited exactly once and the load of a vehicle must not exceed its capacity. In this paper we introduce two new basic families of valid inequalities, called Lifted and Local Reachability Cuts, respectively, which extend the Reachability Cuts introduced by J. Lysgaard. Separation procedures for Lifted and Local Reachability Cuts have been implemented and embedded into a Branch-and-Cut framework to validate their computational effectiveness. They were tested on the Solomon and on the Gehring-Homberger benchmark instances (also known as the ""Extended Solomon"" instances) with 200 customers. Computational experiments show that the new cutting plane families can substantially improve the lower bounds returned by Lysgaard's Reachability Cuts. The Branch-and-Cut algorithm could also provide the optimal solution of three previously unsolved instances - C222, C225 and C226 - with large capacities and wide time windows and therefore difficult for exact algorithms. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows Mixed Integer Programming Branch and Cut","Branch-and-cut algorithms; Computational experiment; Exact algorithms; Fleet of vehicles; Mixed integer programming; Optimal solutions; Valid inequality; Vehicle routing problem with time windows; Algorithms; Fleet operations; Linear programming; Vehicle routing; Sales",,,,,"Applegate, D., Bixby, R., Chvátal, V., Cook, W., Implementing the Dantzig-Fulkerson-Johnson algorithm for large traveling salesman problems (2003) Mathematical Programming, 97, pp. 91-153; Ascheuer, N., Fischetti, M., Grötschel, M., A polyhedral study of the asymmetric traveling salesman problem with time windows (2000) Networks, 36 (2), pp. 69-79; Baldacci, R., Mingozzi, A., Roberti, R., New route relaxation and pricing strategies for the vehicle routing problem (2011) Operations Research, 59 (5), pp. 1269-1283; Baldacci, R., Mingozzi, A., Roberti, R., (2010), Personal communication; Bard, J.F., Kontoravdis, G., Yu, G., A branch-and-cut procedure for the vehicle routing problem with time windows (2002) Transportation Science, 36 (2), pp. 250-269; Chabrier, A., Vehicle routing problem with elementary shortest path based column generation (2006) Computers & Operations Research, 33 (10), pp. 2972-2990; Cook, W., Rich, J.L., (1999) A Parallel Cutting-plane Algorithm for the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows, , Technical Report.

Large cities are demanding more and more share transportation services with flexible routes, resulting from user dynamic demands. In this study a new algorithm is proposed for solving the problem of computing the best routes that a public transportation company could offer to satisfy a number of customer requests. In this problem, known in the literature as the dial-a-ride problem, a number of passengers has to be transported between pickup and delivery locations trying to minimize the routing costs while respecting a set of pre-specified constraints (maximum pickup time, maximum ride duration and maximum load per vehicle). For optimizing this problem, a new variable neighborhood search has been developed and tested on a set of 24 different scenarios of a large-scale dial-a-ride problem in the city of San Francisco. The results have been compared against two state-of-the-art algorithms of the literature and validated by means of statistical procedures proving that the new algorithm has obtained the best overall results. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Lyngby, Denmark","The largest airports have a daily average throughput of more than 500 passengers with reduced mobility. The problem of transporting these passengers is in some cases a multi-modal transportation problem with synchronization constraints. A description of the problem together with a mathematical model is presented. The objective is to schedule as many of the passengers as possible, while ensuring a smooth transport with short waiting times. A simulated annealing based heuristic for solving the problem is presented. The algorithm makes use of an abstract representation of a candidate solution which in each step is transformed to an actual schedule by use of a greedy heuristic. Local search is performed on the abstract representation using advanced neighborhoods which modify large parts of the candidate solution. Computational results show that the algorithm is able to find good solutions within a couple of minutes, making the algorithm applicable for dynamic scheduling. Moreover high-quality solutions can be obtained by running the algorithm for 10 minutes. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Typically, users place transportation requests, specifying a pickup and a drop off location and a fleet of minibuses or taxis is used to serve these requests. The underlying optimization problem can be modeled as a dial-a-ride problem. In the dial-a-ride problem considered in this paper, total routing costs are minimized while respecting time window, maximum user ride time, maximum route duration, and vehicle capacity restrictions.

One of the possible actions towards a solution to this problem is the planning, design and implementation of efficient feeder transit services. This paper develops an analytical model which allows for an easy computation of near optimal terminal-to-terminal cycle length of a demand responsive feeder service to maximize service quality provided to customers, defined as the inverse of a weighted sum of waiting and riding times. The model estimates the recommended cycle length by only plugging in geometrical parameters and demand data, without relying on extensive simulation analyses or rule of thumbs. Simulation experiments and comparisons with real services validate our model, which would allow planners, decision makers and practitioners to quickly identify the best feeder transit operating design of any given residential area. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Continuous approximations; Demand responsive; Feeder transit; First/last mile; Optimal cycle; Transit performance","Decision making; Geometry; Mass transportation; Continuous approximations; Demand responsive; Feeder transit; First/last mile; Optimal cycle; Transit performance; Feeding; computer simulation; numerical model; public transport",,,,,"Ahouissoussi, N.B.C., Wetzstein, M.E., A comparative cost analysis of biodiesel, compressed natural gas, methanol, and diesel for transit bus systems (1998) Resource and Energy Economics, 20 (1), pp. 1-15; Aldaihani, M.M., Quadrifoglio, L., Dessouky, M.M., Hall, R., Network design for a grid hybrid transit service (2004) Transportation Research Part A, 38 (7), pp. 511-530; Alp, O., Erkip, N.K., Güllü, R., Optimal lot-sizing/vehicle-dispatching policies under stochastic lead times and stepwise fixed costs (2003) Operations Research, 51 (1), pp. 160-166; Badami, M.G., Haider, M., An analysis of public bus transit performance in Indian cities (2007) Transportation Research Part A, 41 (10), pp. 961-981; Barr, R.S., Golden, B.L., Kelly, J.P., Resende, M.G.C., Stewart, W.R., Designing and reporting on computational experiments with heuristic methods (1995) Journal of Heuristics, 1 (1), pp. 9-32; Beardwood, J., Halton, J.H., Hammersley, J.M., (1959) The Shortest Path through Many Points.

The problem includes a set of practical complications that have received little attention in the vehicle routing literature. There are multiple vehicle types available to cover a set of transportation orders with different pickup and delivery time windows. Transportation orders and vehicle types must satisfy a set of compatibility constraints. In addition, we include some dock service capacity constraints as required in real-world operations when there are a large number of vehicles to schedule. This problem requires to be attended on large scale instances: transportation orders ≥ 500, single-haul vehicles ≥ 100. Exact algorithms are not suitable for large scale instances. We propose a model to solve the problem in three stages. The first stage constructs initial solutions at the aggregated level relaxing time windows and dock service constraints of the original problem. The other two stages impose time windows and dock service constraints within a cut generation scheme. Our results are favorable in finding good quality solutions in relatively short computational time.","Logistics and transportation planning; PDP-TWDS; Time windows; Vehicle routing optimization",,,,,,"Ascheuer, N., Fischetti, M., Grotschel, M., Solving the asymmetric travelling salesman problem with time windows by branch-and-cut (2001) Mathematical Programming, Series A, 90 (3), pp. 475-506; Cook, W., Rich, J.L., (1999) A Parallel Cutting-plane Algorithm for the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (TR99-04), , Houston, TX: Rice University, Computational and Applied Mathematics; Cordeau, J.F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial - A-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54 (3), pp. 573-586; Desrosiers, J., Dumas, Y., Solomon, M.M., Sournis, F., Time constrained routing and scheduling (1995) Handbooks in Operations Research and Management Science, 8, pp. 35-139. , Network Routing; Dumas, Y., Desrosiers, J., Soumis, F., The pickup and delivery problem with time windows (1991) European Journal of Operational Research, 54 (1), pp. 7-22; Dumas, Y., Desrosiers, J., Solomon, M., An optimal algorithm for the traveling salesman problem with Time Windows (1995) Operations Research, 43 (2), pp. 367-371; Lu, Q., Dessouky, M.M., A new insertion-based construction heuristic for solving the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2006) European Journal of Operational Research, 175 (2), pp. 672-687; Palmgren, M., (2001) Optimisation Methods for Log Truck Scheduling, , PhD Thesis, Linköpings Universitet, Linköping, Sweden; Parragh, S.N., Doerner, K.F., Hartl, R.F., A survey on pickup and delivery problems.

The vehicle contains a number of (horizontal) stacks of finite capacity for loading items from the rear of the vehicle. Each stack must satisfy the last-in-first-out constraint that states that any new item must be loaded on top of a stack and any unloaded item must be on top of its stack. A branch-and-cut algorithm is proposed for solving this problem. Computational results are reported on different types of randomly generated instances as well as on classical instances for some well-known special cases of the problem. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The challenge is to minimize both the number of required cars and the additional cost in terms of time for the drivers. There are two resulting problems that are interdependent and NP-complete: assigning passengers to cars and finding the shortest path for the drivers so that the overall cost is minimized. In this paper, we consider a multiobjective dynamic car pooling problem, where both the cost and the total travel time of drivers are to be minimized. We based on labeling algorithms for solving the multiobjective shortest problem investigate a new algorithm to solve this problem. Preliminary numerical results in a real scenario are reported. They show that our proposed algorithm is efficient and promising to real time applications. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Additional costs; Car pooling; Labeling algorithms; Multi objective; NP Complete; Numerical results; Overall costs; Real-time application; Shortest path; Transport solution; Algorithms; Costs; Information science; Technology; Problem solving",,,,,"Parragh, S.N., Doerner, K.F., Hartl, R.F., A survey on pickup and delivery problems, Part II: Transportation between pickup and delivery locations (2008) Journal fur Betriebswirtschaft, 58 (2), pp. 81-117; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem (DARP): Variants modeling issues and algorithms (2003) 40R, 1, pp. 89-1O1; Baldacci, R., Maniezzo, V., Mingozzi, A., An Exact Method for the Car Pooling Problem Based on Lagrangean Column Generation (2004) Oper.

The work presented here was inspired by a daily route planning problem at a regional air carrier who was trying to determine the benefits of transshipment. Accordingly, a primary goal of this paper is identify the circumstances under which measurable cost saving can be achieved when one aircraft transports a request from its origin to an intermediate point and a second aircraft picks it up and delivers it to its final destination. In structuring the analysis, we describe a unique way to model this transshipment option on a directed graph and introduce a specialized two-route insertion heuristic that considers when to exploit this option. Based on the new representation, most existing heuristics for the PDP can be readily extended to handle transshipments. To find solutions, we developed a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) with several novel features. In the construction phase, shipment requests are inserted into routes until all demand is satisfied or no feasible insertion exists. In the improvement phase, an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm is used to modify portions of the feasible routes. Specialized removal and insertion heuristics were designed for this purpose. In the absence of test cases in the literature, we also developed a procedure for randomly generating problem instances. Testing was done on 56 existing PDP instances which have 50 requests each, and on 50 new data sets with 25 requests each and one transshipment location. For the former, the performance and solution quality of the GRASP were comparable to the best known heuristics.

The demand responsive transport systems (DRTS) seem to be the solution for the trade-off between flexibility and efficiency. They require the planning of travel paths (routing) and customers pick-up and drop-off times (scheduling) according to received requests and respecting the limited capacity of the fleet and time constraints (hard time windows) for each network's node. Even considering invariable conditions of the network a DRTS may operate according to a static or to a dynamic mode. In the dynamic mode, customers' requests arrive when the service is already running and, consequently, the solution may change over time. In this work, we use an algorithm able to solve a dynamic multi-vehicle DaRP by managing incoming transport demand as fast as possible. The heuristics is a greedy method that tries to assign the requests to one of the fleet's vehicles finding each time the local optimum. The usage of vehicles only when strictly necessary, provides to costs minimization. The work is enriched by a series of tests with different values of the fleet's vehicles and their capacity, of time windows and of incoming requests' number. The solutions provided by the heuristics are simulated in a discrete events environment in which it's possible to reproduce the movement of the buses, the passengers' arrival to the stops, and in the next step the delays due to the traffic congestion and possible anomalies in the behaviour of the passengers. Finally, at the end of the simulation, a set of performance indicators evaluate the solution planned by the heuristics. © 2012 IFAC.","Demand responsive transport systems; Dial-a-Ride Problem; Discrete event simulation; Heuristics; Public transport","Demand responsive transport systems; Dial-a-ride problem; Discrete events; Dynamic modes; Greedy method; Heuristics; Limited capacity; Local optima; Multi-vehicles; Performance indicators; Public transport; Time constraints; Time windows; Transport demand; Transport systems; Benchmarking; Costs; Discrete event simulation; Fleet operations; Manufacture; Traffic congestion; Transportation",,,,,"Aldaihani, M., Dessouky, M.M., Hybrid scheduling methods for paratransit operations (2003) Computers and Industrial Engineering, 45, pp. 75-96; Beaudry, A., Laporte, G., Melo, T., Nickel, S., Dynamic transportation of patients to hospitals (2010) OR Spectrum, 32, pp. 77-107; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., Dynamic pickup and delivery problems (2010) European Journal of Operational Research, 202, pp. 8-15; Bergvinsdottir, K.B., Larsen, J., Jørgensen, R.M., Solving the dial-a-ride problem using genetic algorithms (2004) IMM-technical Report-2004-20, Informatics and Mathematical Modelling, , Technical University of Denmark; Bodin, L.D., Sexton, T., The multi-vehicle subscriber dial-a-ride problem (1986) TIMS Studies in Management Science, 2, pp. 73-86; Borndörfer, R., Klostermeier, F., Grötschel, M., Küttner, C., Telebus berlin: Vehicle scheduling in a dial-a-ride system (1997) Technical Report SC 97-23, Konrad-zuse-zentrum für Informationstechnik, , Berlin; Brotcorne, L., Laporte, G., Semet, F., Ambulance location and relocation models (2003) European Journal of Operational Research, 147, pp. 451-468; Brown, F., Harris, M.G., Other, A.N., Name of paper (1998) Name of Book in Italics, , Name(s) of editor(s) (ed.) page numbers.

We research how to create a decentralized multi-agent system that can solve the dynamic dial-a-ride problem. Normally multi-agent systems are hand designed for each specific application. In this paper we research the applicability of genetic programming to automatically program a multi-agent system that solves dial-a-ride problems. We evaluated the evolved system by running a number of simulations and compared it's performance to a selection hyper-heuristic. The results shows that genetic programming can be a viable alternative to hand constructing multi-agent systems.

Main reasons for launching public bike program is to reduce carbon footprint so as to prevent greenhouse effect and to solve Last-Mile problem in order to make convenient for citizens. However, we may encounter awkward cases in peak hours (from 7:00 to 9:00 and 17:00 to 19:00) that no bike is available at some stations or no vacant place is left to put bikes. The actual solution in most cities is in a traditional way based on call centers. A personnel taking charge of bikes in a certain zone reallocates bikes among bike stations based on notification of bike users by telephone call when bike stations are full or empty. This inefficient solution will reduce bike utilization and even annoy bike users. In this paper, we propose a system & methodology to intelligently guide personnel to reallocate bikes among stations, aiming at overcoming the above awkward cases and maximizing bike utilization. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Call centers; Telephone calls; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Greenhouse effect; Bicycles",,,,,"DeMaio, P., Bike sharing: Its history, models of provision, and future Velo City Conference, 2009; Ropke, S., Cordeau, J., Laport, G., Models and branch-and-cut algorithms for pickup and delivery problems with time windows (2007) Networks, 49 (4), pp. 258-272; Ropke, S., Cordeau, J., Branch and cut and price for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2009) Transportation Science, 43 (3), pp. 267-286; Li, H., Lim, A., A metaheuristic for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows International Conference of Tools Artificial Intelligence, 2001; Lai, M., Cao, E., An improved differential evolution algorithm for vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickups and deliveries and time windows (2010) Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 23 (2), pp. 188-195; Lu, Q., Dessouky, M., An exact algorithm for the multiple vehicle pickup and delivery problem (2004) Transportation Science, 38 (4), pp. 503-514; Baldacci, R., Mingozzi, A., An exact algorithm for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2011) Operations Research, 59 (2), pp. 414-426; IBM Ilog Cplex Solver 12.0","Li, J.; Supply Chain Management and Logistics Research, IBM Research-China, Diamond Building 19-A, Donbeiwang West Road No.8, Beijing, 100193, China; email: ljinfeng@cn.ibm.com",,,,"2012 9th IEEE International Conference on Networking, Sensing and Control, ICNSC 2012","11 April 2012 through 14 April 2012","Beijing",90782,,9781467303880,,,"English","Proc.

This problem is characterized by the presence of heterogeneous vehicles and patients. In our problem, two types of vehicles are used, each providing a different capacity for four different modes of transportation. Patients may request to be transported either seated, on a stretcher or in a wheelchair. In addition, some may require accompanying persons. The problem is to construct a minimum-cost routing plan satisfying service-related criteria, expressed in terms of time windows, as well as driver-related constraints expressed in terms of maximum route duration limits and mandatory lunch breaks. We introduce both a three-index and a set-partitioning formulation of the problem. The linear programming relaxation of the latter is solved by a column generation algorithm. We also propose a variable neighborhood search heuristic. Finally, we integrate the heuristic and the column generation approach into a collaborative framework. The column generation algorithm and the collaborative framework provide tight lower bounds on the optimal solution values for small-to-medium-sized instances. The variable neighborhood search algorithm yields high-quality solutions for realistic test instances. © 2010 The Author(s).","Column generation; Dial-a-ride-problem; Passenger transportation; Variable neighborhood search",,,,,,"Beaudry, A., Laporte, G., Melo, T., Nickel, S., Dynamic transportation of patients to hospitals (2009) OR Spectrum, 32, pp. 77-107; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Gribkovskaia, I., Laporte, G., Static pickup and delivery problems: a classification scheme and survey (2007) Top, 15, pp. 1-31; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Dynamic pickup and delivery problems (2010) Eur J Oper Res, 202, pp. 8-15; Černy, V., Thermodynamical approach to the traveling salesman problem: An efficient simulation algorithm (1985) J Opt Theory Appl, 45, pp. 41-51; Cordeau, J.-F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Oper Res, 54, pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transport Res B Meth, 37, pp. 579-594; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem: models and algorithms (2007) Ann Oper Res, 153, pp. 29-46; Danna, E., Lepape, C., Branch-and-price heuristics: a case study on the vehicle routing problem with time windows (2005) Column Generation, pp. 99-129. , G.

The system simulates the operation of a dynamic dial-a-ride service that operates with multiple fleets of vehicles with different capacities, schedules and depots. It can be used to investigate how the setting of service and cost parameters and the design of the service affect the total cost for the operator and level of service for the customer.

Experiments show that the constraint programming algorithm is sometimes able to accept or reject incoming requests, and that the hybrid method outperforms each of the two algorithms when they are executed alone.","Constraint programming; Dial-a-ride problem; Dynamic; Scheduling; Tabu search","Constraint programming; Dial-a-ride problem; Exact constraint; Hybrid algorithms; Hybrid method; Hybrid tabu search; Real time; Service requests; Tabu Search heuristic; Computer programming; Constraint theory; Dynamics; Heuristic algorithms; Scheduling; Tabu search",,,,,"Attanasio, A., Cordeau, J.-F., Ghiani, G., Laporte, G., Parallel tabu search heuristics for the dynamic multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2004) Parallel Comput., 30 (3), pp. 377-387; Beaudry, A., Laporte, G., Melo, T., Nickel, S., Dynamic transportation of patients in hospitals (2010) OR Spectrum, 32 (1), pp. 77-107; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Dynamic pickup and delivery problems (2010) Eur.

The first stage adopts improved ant colony optimization (IACO) to determine the minimum number of used vehicles. The second stage employs improved Tabu search to optimize the total travel cost, in which the initial solutions are obtained by IACO in the first stage.

There is, however, little in the literature on effective models and solution methods for solving the taxi pooling problem. Thus, in this study we employ network flow techniques and a mathematical programming method to develop a taxi pooling solution method. This method is composed of three models. First, a fleet routing/scheduling model is constructed to produce fleet/passenger routes and schedules. A solution algorithm, based on Lagrangian relaxation, a sub-gradient method and a heuristic to find the upper bound of the solution, is proposed to solve the fleet routing/scheduling model. Then, two single taxi-passenger matching models are constructed with the goals of decreasing number of passenger transfers and matching all passengers and taxis. These two taxi-passenger matching models are directly solved using a mathematical programming solver. For comparison with the solution method, we also develop another heuristic by modifying a heuristic recently proposed for solving a one-to-many taxi pooling problem. The performance of the solution method and the additional heuristic are evaluated by carrying out a case study using real data and suitable assumptions. The test results show that these two solution methods could be useful in practice. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Lagrangian relaxation; Mathematical programming; Multiple commodity network flow problem; Multiple origins/destinations; Taxi pooling","Experience-based methods; LaGrangian relaxation; Matching models; Multiple commodity network flow problem; Multiple origins/destinations; Network flow techniques; Pooling problem; Solution algorithms; Solution methods; Taxi pooling; Three models; Upper Bound; Gradient methods; Lagrange multipliers; Mathematical programming; Taxicabs; Heuristic methods; algorithm; heuristics; Lagrangian analysis; numerical method; taxi transport; Taiwan",,,,,"Aldaihani, M., Dessouky, M., Hybrid scheduling methods for paratransit operations (2003) Comput.

In this problem, commodities need to be delivered directly from their origins to their destinations within specified time windows, using a fleet of homogenous capacitated vehicles. A set of routes, each of which performs one or several direct deliveries, need to be constructed such that the operational costs, including vehicle fixed cost, variable traveling and variable waiting costs, are minimized. The problem arises, for example, when delivering food products from several factories, where they are manufactured, to several distribution centers, from which they are delivered to the final customers. We define the problem and describe its relationship to existing problems studied in the literature, in particular pickup and delivery, assignment and scheduling problems. Subsequently we develop a solution method which is based on decomposing (partitioning) the ASTV problem into two interdependent sub-problems. The first consists of Assignment of Tasks to origin-destination full-load Trips (ATT), while the second determines assignment and Scheduling of these Trips to Vehicle routes (STV). We use a bi-criterion objective function in the first problem, whose purpose is to connect the two problems by looking ahead to the rest of the decisions, determined in the second problem. Thus, the solution method is referred to as lookahead partitioning. In this way, decisions of the first problem determine a favorable input for the second problem, which is solved last. An extensive numerical study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the overall heuristic method. The results indicate that our heuristic method is quite efficient. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Although car pooling is becoming more common, in practice, participant matching results are still being obtained by an inefficient manual approach, which may possibly result in an inferior solution. In the past, when car pooling studies have been done the problem has been treated as either a to-work problem (from different origins to the same destination) or return-from-work problem (from the same origin to different destinations). However, in this study we employ a time-space network flow technique to develop a model for the many-to-many car pooling problem with multiple vehicle types and person types. The model is formulated as an integer multiple commodity network flow problem. Since real problem sizes can be huge, it could be difficult to find optimal solutions within a reasonable period of time. Therefore, we develop a solution algorithm based on Lagrangian relaxation, a subgradient method, and a heuristic for the upper bound solution, to solve the model. To test how well the model and the solution algorithm can be applied to real world, we randomly generated several examples based upon data reported from a past study carried out in northern Taiwan, on which we performed numerical tests. The test results show the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution algorithm. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Car pooling; Lagrangian relaxation; Many-to-many; Multiple commodity network flow problem;

Pre-matching information, including the carpool partners and the route/schedule for each previously participating vehicle, have rarely been considered. As a result, there has not yet been a suitable method/model developed for solving practical many-to-many car pooling problem with multiple vehicle and person types, as well as pre-matching information, that occur in real-world. In this study we strive to make up this lack by employing a time-space network flow technique to develop a model for this type of car pooling problem with pre-matching information (CPPPMI). The model is formulated as an integer multiple commodity network flow problem. A solution algorithm, based on Lagrangian relaxation and a heuristic for the upper bound solution, is developed to solve the model. To test how well the model and the solution algorithm may be applied to real-world, numerical tests are performed with several problem instances randomly generated based upon data reported from a past study carried out in northern Taiwan. The test results show the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution algorithm. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The problem arises from an on-demand transportation system developed in a rural zone in France, where the objective of encouraging people meeting is pursued. We address the solution of the problem with a column generation approach, applied to a set partitioning formulation where the objective function is fractional. Based on the literature on linear fractional programming, two methods are developed to deal with this fractional objective. Experiments permit to compare these two approaches and to evaluate the impact of the new objective compared to a standard min-cost or min-time optimization. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

A fleet of vehicles, without fixed routes and schedules, carries people from their pickup points to their delivery points, during a pre-specified time interval. It can be modeled as an -hard routing and scheduling problem, with a suitable mixed integer programming formulation. Exact approaches to this problem are too limited to tackle real-life instances: time dependent network, requests received on-line, different objective functions. In this paper we propose an algorithm to solve the off-line Dial-a-Ride Problem (darp), based on a Granular Tabu Search method.

In many cases the solution is to realize demand responsive transportation system. A Demand Responsive Transport System (DRTS) requires the planning of travel paths (routing) and customer pick-up and drop-off times (scheduling) according to received requests. In particular, the problem has to deal with multiple vehicles, limited capacity of the fleet vehicles and temporal constraints (time windows). A DRTS may operate according to static or dynamic mode. In the static setting, all the customer requests are known beforehand and the DRTS solves a Dial-a-Ride Problem (DaRP) instance, to produce the tour of each bus, respecting the pick up and delivery time windows while minimising the solution cost. In the dynamic mode, the customer requests arrive overtime to a control station and, consequently, the solution may also change over time. In this work, we address a Demand Responsive Transport System capable of managing incoming transport demand using a two-stage algorithm by solving a DaRP instance. The solutions provided by the heuristics are simulated in a discrete events environment in which it is possible to reproduce the movement of the buses, the passengers' arrival to the stops, the delays due to the traffic congestion and possible anomalies in the behaviour of the passengers.

Athena, Greece","In the dynamic Pickup and Delivery Problem with Transfers (dPDPT), a set of transportation requests that arrive at arbitrary times must be assigned to a fleet of vehicles. We use two cost metrics that capture both the company's and the customer's viewpoints regarding the quality of an assignment. In most related problems, the rule of thumb is to apply a two-phase local search algorithm to heuristically determine a good requests-to-vehicles assignment. This work proposes a novel solution based on a graph-based formulation of the problem that treats each request independently. Briefly, in this conceptual graph, the goal is to find a shortest path from a node representing the pickup location to that of the delivery location. However, we show that efficient Bellman-Ford or Dijkstra-like algorithms cannot be applied. Still, our method is able to find dPDPT solutions significantly faster than a conventional two-phase local search algorithm, while the quality of the solution is only marginally lower. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","dynamic shortest path; Pickup and delivery problem","Bellman-Ford; Conceptual graph; Cost metrics; Dynamic shortest path; Graph-based; Local search algorithm; Novel solutions; Pickup and delivery; Pickup and delivery problem; Pickup and delivery problems; Rule of thumb; Shortest path; Fleet operations; Graph theory; Learning algorithms; Pickups",,,,,"Agrawal, R., Jagadish, H.V., Materialization and incremental update of path information (1989) ICDE, pp. 374-383; Bent, R., Hentenryck, P.V., A two-stage hybrid algorithm for pickup and delivery vehicle routing problems with time windows (2006) Computers and Operations Research, 33 (4), pp. 875-893; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., Dynamic pickup and delivery problems (2010) European Journal of Operational Research, 202 (1), pp. 8-15; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.F., Gribkovskaia, I., Laporte, G., Static pickup and delivery problems: A classification scheme and survey (2007) TOP, 15, pp. 1-31; Carraway, R.L., Morin, T.L., Moskowitz, H., Generalized dynamic programming for multicriteria optimization (1990) European Journal of Operational Research, 44 (1), pp. 95-104; Cheng, J., Yu, J.X., On-line exact shortest distance query processing (2009) EDBT, pp. 481-492; Cohen, E., Halperin, E., Kaplan, H., Zwick, U., Reachability and distance queries via 2-hop labels (2002) SODA, pp. 937-946; Cooke, K.L., Halsey, E., The shortest route through a network with time-dependent internodal transit times (1966) Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications, 14 (3), pp. 493-498; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., Ropke, S., Recent Models and Algorithms for One-to-One Pickup and Delivery Problems (2008) Vehicle Routing: Latest Advances and Challenges, pp. 327-357. , Kluwer, Dordrecht; Cordeau, J.F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54 (3), pp. 573-586; Cortés, C.E., Matamala, M., Contardo, C., The pickup and delivery problem with transfers: Formulation and a branch-and-cut solution method (2010) European Journal of Operational Research, 200 (3), pp. 711-724; Ding, B., Yu, J.X., Qin, L., Finding time-dependent shortest paths over large graphs (2008) EDBT, pp. 205-216; Dreyfus, S.E., An appraisal of some shortest-path algorithms (1969) Operations Research, 17 (3); Dumas, Y., Desrosiers, J., Soumis, F., The pickup and delivery problem with time windows (1991) European Journal of Operational Research, 54 (1), pp. 7-22; Gendreau, M., Guertin, F., Potvin, J.Y., Séguin, R., Neighbourhood search heuristics for a dynamic vehicle dispatching problem with pick-ups and deliveries (2006) Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 14 (3), pp. 157-174; Goldberg, A.V., Harrelson, C., Computing the shortest path: A search meets graph theory (2005) SODA 2005: Proceedings of the Sixteenth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, pp. 156-165; Goldberg, A.V., Kaplan, H., Werneck, R.F., Reach for A*: Efficient point-to-point shortest path algorithms (2006) Proc. of the 8th WS on Algorithm Engineering and Experiments (ALENEX), pp. 129-143. , SIAM, Philadelphia; Granat, J., Guerriero, F., The interactive analysis of the multicriteria shortest path problem by the reference point method (2003) European Journal of Operational Research, 151 (1), pp. 103-118; Guerriero, F., Musmanno, R., Label correcting methods to solve multicriteria shortest path problems (2001) Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications, 111 (3), pp. 589-613; Jing, N., Huang, Y.W., Rundensteiner, E.A., Hierarchical encoded path views for path query processing: An optimal model and its performance evaluation (1998) TKDE, 10 (3), pp. 409-432; Jung, S., Pramanik, S., An efficient path computation model for hierarchically structured topographical road maps (2002) TKDE, 14 (5), pp. 1029-1046; Kriegel, H.P., Renz, M., Schubert, M., Route skyline queries: A multi-preference path planning approach (2010) ICDE, pp. 261-272; Li, H., Lim, A., A metaheuristic for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2001) ICTAI, pp. 333-340; Mitrović-Minić, S., Krishnamurti, R., Laporte, G., Double-horizon based heuristics for the dynamic pickup and delivery problem (2004) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 38 (7), pp. 669-685; Mitrović-Minić, S., Laporte, G., Waiting strategies for the dynamic pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2004) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 38 (7), pp. 635-655; Mitrović-Minić, S., Laporte, G., The pickup and delivery problem with time windows and transshipment (2006) INFOR, 44 (3), pp. 217-228; Orda, A., Rom, R., Shortest-path and minimum-delay algorithms in networks with time-dependent edge-length (1990) J.

If a customer is absent when the vehicle serves the pickup location, the request is fulfilled by an alternative service (e.g., a taxi) whose cost is added to the total cost of the tour. In this case, the vehicle skips the corresponding delivery location, which yields a reduction in the total tour cost. The aim of the problem is to determine an a priori Hamiltonian tour minimizing the expected cost of the solution. This problem is solved by means of an integer L-shaped algorithm. Computational experiments show that the algorithm yields optimal solutions on several instances within reasonable CPU times. It is also shown that the actual cost of an optimal solution obtained with this algorithm can be significantly smaller than that of an optimal solution obtained with a deterministic formulation. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This paper proposes a solution method based on constraint programming and mathematical programming for a log-truck scheduling problem. The problem consists of scheduling the transportation of logs between forest areas and woodmills, as well as routing the fleet of vehicles to satisfy these transportation requests. The objective is to minimize the total cost of the non-productive activities such as the waiting time of trucks and forest log-loaders and the empty driven distance of vehicles. We propose a constraint programming model to address the combined scheduling and routing problem and an integer programming model to deal with the optimization of deadheads. Both of these models are combined through the exchange of global constraints. Finally the whole approach is validated on real industrial data. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,,,,,,"Andersson, G., Flisberg, P., Liden, P., Rönnqvist, M., RuttOpt-a decision support system for routing of logging trucks (2008) Canadian Journal of Forest Research, 38, pp. 1784-1796; Bredström, D., Rönnqvist, M., Combined vehicle routing and scheduling with temporal precedence and synchronization constraints (2008) European Journal of Operational Research, 191 (1), pp. 19-31; Baptiste, P., LePape, C., Nuijten, W., Constraint-based optimization and approximation for job-shop scheduling (1995) AAAI-SIGMAN workshop on intelligent manufacturing systems, IJCAI'95, pp. 5-16. , Montreal, Canada; Baptiste, P., Lepape, C., Nuijten, W., (2001) Constraint-Based Scheduling, , Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic; Fahle, T., Sellmann, M., Constraint programming based column generation with knapsack subproblems (2000) Proceeding of the international workshop on integration of AI and OR techniques in constraint programming for combinatorial optimisation problems (CP-AI-OR00), pp. 33-43; Freling, R., Huisman, D., Wagelmans, A.P.M., Models and algorithms for integration of vehicle and crew scheduling (2003) Journal of Scheduling, 6, pp. 63-85; Flisberg, P., Liden, B., Rönnqvist, M., A hybrid method based on linear programming and tabu search for routing of logging trucks (2010) Computers and Operations Research; Gronalt, M., Hirsch, P., Log-truck scheduling with tabu search strategy (2007) Metaheuristics, 39, pp. 65-88; Haase, K., Desaulniers, G., Desrosiers, J., Simultaneous vehicle and crew scheduling in urban mass transit systems (2001) Transportation Science, 35 (3), pp. 286-303; Hooker, J.N., A hybrid method for the planning and scheduling (2005) Constraints, 10 (4), pp. 385-401; Linnainmaa, S., Savalo, J., Jokinen, O., (1995) EPO: A knowledge based system for wood procurement management, , Paper presented at the 7th Annual Conference on Artifical Intelligence, Montreal; Michaelsen, J., (1994) Productivité des chargeuses de bois courts, , (Communiqué Technique N: Chargement et Camionnage-37 Sommaire de rapport interne de FERIC); Milano, M., (2004) Constraint and Integer Programming, , Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic; Murphy, G., Reducing trucks on the road through optimal route scheduling and shared log transport services (2003) Southern Journal of Applied Forestry, 27 (3), pp. 198-205; Palmgren, M., Rönnqvist, M., Värbrand, P., A solution approach for log truck scheduling based on composite pricing and branch and bound (2003) International Transactions in Operational Research, 10, pp. 433-447; Palmgren, M., Rönnqvist, M., Värbrand, P., A near-exact method for solving the log-truck scheduling problem (2004) International Transactions in Operational Research, 11, pp. 447-464; Régin, J.-C., Generalized arc consistency for global cardinality constraint (1996) Proceedings of AAAI/IAAI, 1, pp. 209-215. , Menlo Park: AAAI Press/The MIT Press; Rönnqvist, M., Optimization in forestry (2003) Mathematics Programming, 97, pp. 267-284; Rönnqvist, M., Ryan, D., Solving truck dispatch problem in real time (1995) Proceedings of the 31st Annual Conference of the Operational Research Society of New Zealand, pp. 165-172. , Wellington, New Zealand31 August-1 September 1995, Auckland: The Operational Research Society of New Zealand; Rönnqvist, M., Sahlin, H., Carlsson, D., (1998) Operative planning and dispatching of forestry transportation, , (Report LiTH-MAT-R-1998-18).

In the PDPTW, a set of identical vehicles located at a central depot must be optimally routed to service a set of transportation requests subject to capacity, time window, pairing, and precedence constraints. In this paper, we present a new exact algorithm for the PDPTW based on a set-partitioning-like integer formulation, and we describe a bounding procedure that finds a near-optimal dual solution of the LP-relaxation of the formulation by combining two dual ascent heuristics and a cut-and-column generation procedure. The final dual solution is used to generate a reduced problem containing only the routes whose reduced costs are smaller than the gap between a known upper bound and the lower bound achieved. If the resulting problem has moderate size, it is solved by an integer programming solver; otherwise, a branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm is used to close the integrality gap. Extensive computational results over the main instances from the literature show the effectiveness of the proposed exact method. © 2011 INFORMS.","Column generation; Dual ascent; Pickup and delivery; Set partitioning","Bounding procedures; Branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm; Column generation; Computational results; Dual ascent; Dual solutions; Exact algorithms; Exact methods; Integrality gaps; Lower bounds; LP-relaxation; Pickup and delivery; Pickup and delivery problem with time windows; Precedence constraints; Reduced cost; Set partitioning; Time windows; Upper Bound; Vehicle routing problem with time windows; Algorithms; Integer programming; Pickups; Vehicle routing",,,,,"Baldacci, R., Christofides, N., Mingozzi, A., An exact algorithm for the vehicle routing problem based on the set partitioning formulation with additional cuts (2008) Math.

Given the fact that people are subject to transportation, constraints related to quality of service are usually present, such as time windows and maximum user ride time limits. In many real world applications, different types of users exist. In the field of patient and disabled people transportation, up to four different transportation modes can be distinguished. In this article we consider staff seats, patient seats, stretchers and wheelchair places. Furthermore, most companies involved in the transportation of the disabled or ill dispose of different types of vehicles. We introduce both aspects into state-of-the-art formulations and branch-and-cut algorithms for the standard dial-a-ride problem. Also a recent metaheuristic method is adapted to this new problem. In addition, a further service quality related issue is analyzed: vehicle waiting time with passengers aboard. Instances with up to 40 requests are solved to optimality. High quality solutions are obtained with the heuristic method. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Branch-and-cut; Dial-a-ride; Heterogeneous fleet; Heterogeneous passengers; Variable neighborhood search","Integer programming; Optimization; Quality of service; Transportation; Vehicles; Branch and cut; Dial-a-Ride; Heterogeneous fleet; Heterogeneous passengers; Variable neighborhood search; Heuristic methods; algorithm; heuristics; modeling; neighborhood; research; transportation mode; travel behavior; location decision; road transport; transportation planning",,,,,"Ascheuer, N., Fischetti, M., Grötschel, M., A polyhedral study of the asymmetric traveling salesman problem with time windows (2000) Networks, 36, pp. 69-79; Balas, E., Fischetti, M., Pulleyblank, W.R., The precedence-constraint asymmetric traveling salesman polytope (1995) Math.

In this paper we develop the first exact algorithm which is able to either efficiently prove the infeasibility or to provide a feasible solution. Such an algorithm could be used in a dynamic setting for determining whether it is possible or not to accept an incoming request. The algorithm includes solution space reduction procedures, and filtering algorithms for some DARP relaxations. Computational results show that the filtering algorithms are effective and that the resulting algorithm is advantageous on the more constrained instances. © 2011 INFORMS.","Algorithms; Constraint programming; Dial-A-Ride problem; Dynamic programming; Partial routes; Scheduling","Algorithms; Computer programming; Constraint theory; Fleet operations; Scheduling; Signal filtering and prediction; Computational results; Constraint programming; Dial-a-ride problem; Dynamic settings; Feasible solution; Filtering algorithm; Fleet of vehicles; Partial routes; Dynamic programming",,,,,"Beaudry, A., Laporte, G., Melo, T., Nickel, S., Dynamic transportation of patients in hospitals (2010) OR Spectrum, 32, pp. 77-107; Beldiceanu, N., Carlsson, M., Rampon, J.-X., (2005) Global Constraint Catalog, , http://www.emn.fr/x-info/sdemasse/gccat, Research Report T2005: 08, Swedish Institute of Computer Science.

In practice, usually myopic dispatching heuristics are used, often using look-ahead information. We argue more advanced scheduling methods can help, depending on circumstances. We introduce three basic scheduling approaches (insertion, combined and column generation) for the static problem. We then extend these to a dynamic, real-time setting with rolling horizons. We propose two further real-time scheduling approaches: dynamic assignment with and without look-ahead. The performances of the above five scheduling approaches are compared with two of the best performing look-ahead dispatching rules known from the literature. The performance of the various approaches depends on the facility layout and work distribution. However, column generation, the combined heuristic, and the assignment approach with look-ahead consistently outperform dispatching rules. Column generation can require substantial calculation time but delivers very good performance if sufficient look-ahead information is available. For large scale systems, the combined heuristic and the dynamic assignment approach with look ahead are recommended and have acceptable calculation times. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","dispatching; dynamic scheduling;

In currently implemented systems in the Netherlands, however, we observe a decrease in the quality of service (QoS), expressed in longer travel times for the customers. Currently, generally one transport company is responsible for transporting all customers located in a specified geographic zone. In general it is known that when multiple companies compete on costs, the price for customers decreases. In this paper, we investigate whether a similar result can be achieved when competing on quality instead. To arrive at some first conclusions, we set up a multiagent environment to simulate the assignment of rides to companies through an auction on QoS, and the insertion of allocated rides in the companies' schedules using online optimization. Our results reveal that this set-up improves the quality of the service offered to the customers at moderately higher costs. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","auction; Dial-a-ride; multi-company; quality of service","auction; Dial-a-Ride; Geographic zones; High quality; Multi-agent environment; multi-company; Netherlands; Online optimization; Transport companies; Travel time; Geographic zones; High quality; Multi-agent environment; Netherlands; Online optimization; Transport companies; Customer satisfaction; Industry; Quality control; Quality of service; Sales; Technical presentations; Telecommunication services; Costs; Multi agent systems; Sales; Travel time; Multi agent systems; Quality of service",,,,,"Cordeau, J.F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54, pp. 573-586; Karp, R.M., Reducibility among combinatorial problems (1972) Complexity of Computer Computations, pp. 85-103. , Miller, R.

These problems are generally treated via the representation of the road network as a weighted complete graph. Each arc of the graph represents the shortest route for a possible origin-destination connection. Several attributes can be defined for one arc (travel time, travel cost, etc.), but the shortest route modeled by this arc is computed according to a single criterion, generally travel time. Consequently, some alternative routes proposing a different compromise between the attributes of the arcs are discarded from the solution space. We propose to consider these alternative routes and to evaluate their impact on solution algorithms and solution values through a multigraph representation of the road network. We point out the difficulties brought by this representation for general vehicle routing problems, which drives us to introduce the so-called fixed sequence arc selection problem (FSASP). We propose a dynamic programming solution method for this problem. In the context of an on-demand transportation (ODT) problem, we then propose a simple insertion algorithm based on iterative FSASP solving and a branch-and-price exact method. Computational experiments on modified instances from the literature and on realistic data issued from an ODT system in the French Doubs Central area underline the cost savings brought by the proposed methods using the multigraph model. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The method consists in combining different dual ascent procedures to find a near optimal dual solution of the SP model. Then, a column-and-cut generation algorithm attempts to close the integrality gap left by the dual ascent procedures by adding valid inequalities to the SP formulation. The final dual solution is used to generate a reduced problem containing all optimal integer solutions that is solved by an integer programming solver. In this paper, we describe how this solution framework can be extended to solve different variants of the VRP by tailoring the different bounding procedures to deal with the constraints of the specific variant. We describe how this solution framework has been recently used to derive exact algorithms for a broad class of VRPs such as the capacitated VRP, the VRP with time windows, the pickup and delivery problem with time windows, all types of heterogeneous VRP including the multi depot VRP, and the period VRP. The computational results show that the exact algorithm derived for each of these VRP variants outperforms all other exact methods published so far and can solve several test instances that were previously unsolved. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","Dual ascent; Set partitioning; Valid inequalities; Vehicle routing",,,,,,"Baldacci, R., Mingozzi, A., A unified exact method for solving different classes of vehicle routing problems (2009) Math Program Ser A, 120 (2), pp. 347-380; Baldacci, R., Hadjiconstantinou, E.A., Mingozzi, A., An exact algorithm for the capacitated vehicle routing problem based on a two-commodity network flow formulation (2004) Oper Res, 52, pp. 723-738; Baldacci, R., Maniezzo, V., Mingozzi, A., An exact method for the car pooling problem based on lagrangean column generation (2004) Oper Res, 52, pp. 422-439; Baldacci, R., Bodin, L.D., Mingozzi, A., The multiple disposal facilities and multiple inventory locations rollon-rolloff vehicle routing problem (2006) Comput Oper Res, 33, pp. 2667-2702; Baldacci, R., Toth, P., Vigo, D., Recent advances in vehicle routing exact algorithms (2007) 4OR: Q J Oper Res, 5 (4), pp. 269-298; Baldacci, R., Battarra, M., Vigo, D., Routing a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles (2008) The Vehicle Routing Problem: Latest Advances and New Challenges, Vol 43, , B.

Many do not operate vehicles themselves; instead, they contract out the provision of services. Contractors are paid for each hour of service. They are responsible for hiring crew, forming routes, dispatching, and operating and maintaining agency-owned vehicles. In the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, Metro Mobility, the agency responsible for providing paratransit services, requires contractors to use agency-approved software for booking trips dynamically and sets parameters that guide contractors' practices. Customer trips booked in this fashion may not utilize capacity in the most efficient manner. Therefore, beginning with the daily trip schedules generated by the software, this paper proposes two approaches for improving the efficiency of paratransit operations and estimates the benefit of using these approaches via experiments that utilize Metro Mobility data. The first approach re-optimizes routes developed at the end of each day. The second approach evaluates the benefit to state agencies of selectively using non-dedicated service providers such as taxis. Both approaches are tested on actual data obtained from Metro Mobility. The study shows that a conservative estimate of savings from re-optimization would be approximately 5% of Metro Mobility's operating costs. Savings from the use of taxis are smaller and in the range of hundreds of dollars per day. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We constructed a general mixed integer programming model of VRP-SPDTW. The model contained some classical vehicle routing problems as special cases. We proposed an improved differential evolution algorithm (IDE) for solving this problem. In the algorithm, we firstly adopted the novel decimal coding to construct an initial population, then used some improved differential evolution operators unlike the existing algorithm, and in mutation operation, we used an integer order criterion based on natural number coding method. We introduced a penalty technical to publish the infeasible solution. In addition, in the crossover operation, we designed a self-adapting crossover probability that varied with iteration. We did some numerical experiments, and the results showed that the proposed method is effective for solving VRP-SPDTW.

In particular, the dimension of the TSPPD polytope is determined and several valid inequalities, some of which are facet defining, are introduced.

The aim is to provide an efficient and timely transport service to patients between several locations in a hospital campus. Transportation requests arrive in a dynamic fashion and the solution methodology must therefore be capable of quickly inserting new requests in the current vehicle routes. Contrary to standard dial-a-ride problems, the problem under study includes several complicating constraints which are specific to a hospital context. The study provides a detailed description of the problem and proposes a two-phase heuristic procedure capable of handling its many features. In the first phase a simple insertion scheme is used to generate a feasible solution, which is improved in the second phase with a tabu search algorithm. The heuristic procedure was extensively tested on real data provided by a German hospital. Results show that the algorithm is capable of handling the dynamic aspect of the problem and of providing high-quality solutions. In particular, it succeeded in reducing waiting times for patients while using fewer vehicles. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Dial-a-ride; Dynamic mode; In-house hospital transportation; Tabu search",,,,,,"Aldaihani, M., Dessouky, M., Hybrid scheduling methods for paratransit operations (2003) Comput Ind Eng, 45, pp. 75-96; Attanasio, A., Cordeau, J.-F., Ghiani, G., Laporte, G., Parallel tabu search heuristics for the dynamic multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2004) Parallel Comput, 30, pp. 377-387; Banerjea-brodeur, M., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Lasry, A., Scheduling linen deliveries in a large hospital (1998) J Oper Res Soc, 49, pp. 777-780; Baugh, J., Krishna, G., Kakivaya, R., Stone, J., Intractability of the dial-a-ride problem and a multiobjective solution using simulated annealing (1998) Eng Optim, 30, pp. 91-123; Bent, R., van hentenryck, P., A two-stage hybrid algorithm for pickup and delivery vehicle routing problems with time windows (2006) Comput Oper Res, 33, pp. 875-893; Bodin, L.D., Sexton, T., The multi-vehicle subscriber dial-a-ride problem (1986) TIMS Stud Manage Sci, 22, pp. 73-86; Borndörfer, R., Grötschel, M., Klostermeister, F., Küttner, C., (1997) Telebus Berlin: Vehicle Scheduling in a Dial-a-Ride System, , http://www.zib.de/PaperWeb/abstracts/SC-97-23, Technical Report SC 97-23, Konrad-Zuse-Zentrum für Informationstechnik Berlin, Germany.

Distribution activities commonly arising in real-world chemical supply chains involve the shipping of a number of commodities from factories to customers directly and/or via distribution centers and regional warehouses. To optimally manage such complex distribution systems, a more general vehicle routing problem in supply chain management (VRP-SCM) has been defined. The new VRP-SCM problem better resembles the logistics activities to be planned at multisite manufacturing firms by allowing multiple events at every location. In this way, two or more vehicles can visit a given location to perform pickup and/or delivery operations, and vehicle routes may include several stops at the same site, i.e., multiple tours per route. More important, the allocation of customers to suppliers and the quantities of products shipped from each source to a particular client are additional model decisions. Both the capacitated vehicle routing problem (VRP) and the pickup-and-delivery problem (PDP) can be regarded as particular instances of the new VRP-SCM. The proposed MILP mathematical formulation for the VRP-SCM problem relies on a continuous-time representation and applies the general precedence notion to model the sequencing constraints establishing the ordering of vehicle stops on every route. The approach provides a very detailed set of optimal vehicle routes and schedules to meet all product demands at minimum total transportation cost. Several examples involving up to 26 locations, four products, and six vehicles housed in four different depots have been solved to optimality in very short CPU times. © 2009 American Chemical Society.",,"Capacitated vehicle routing problem; Chemical supply chains; Continuous-time representation; CPU time; Distribution centers; Distribution systems; Manufacturing firms; Mathematical formulation; Multi-products; Multi-site; Multiechelon; Operational planning; Optimal vehicles; Optimality; Optimization approach; Pickup and delivery; Product demand; Real-world; Supply chain network; Transportation cost; Transportation network; Vehicle Routing Problems; Location; Network routing; Routing algorithms; Supply chain management; Transportation routes; Vehicles; Warehouses; Supply chains",,,,,"Chopra, S., Meindl, P., (2001) Supply Chain Management, , Prentice-Hall: Upper Saddle River, NJ, ISBN 0-13-026465-2; Chopra, S., Designing the distribution network in a supply chain (2003) Transp.

Besides the minimum cost objective a client centered objective has been defined. Phase one consists of an iterated variable neighborhood search-based heuristic, generating approximate weighted sum solutions; phase two is a path relinking module, computing additional efficient solutions. Results for two sets of benchmark instances are reported. For the smaller instances, exact efficient sets are generated by means of the ε-constraint method. Comparison shows that the proposed two-phase method is able to generate high-quality approximations of the true Pareto frontier. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Bi-objective optimization; Dial-a-ride problem; Path relinking; Variable neighborhood search","Bi-objective optimization; Constraint methods; Dial-a-ride problem; Efficient sets; High quality; Minimum cost; Multi objective; Pareto frontiers; Path relinking; Phase solutions; Two phase method; Variable neighborhood search; Weighted Sum; Heuristic methods",,,,,"Aiex, R.M., Binato, S., Resende, M.G.C., Parallel GRASP with path relinking for job shop scheduling (2003) Parallel Comput, 29, pp. 393-430; Aiex, R.M., Resende, M.G.C., Pardalos, P.M., Toraldo, G., GRASP with path relinking for the three-index assignment problem (2005) INFORMS J Comput, 17, pp. 224-247; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Gribkovskaia, I., Laporte, G., Static pickup and delivery problems: A classification scheme and survey (2007) TOP, 15, pp. 1-31; Bräysy, O., A reactive variable neighborhood search for the vehicle-routing problem with time windows (2003) INFORMS J Comput, 15, pp. 347-368; Cordeau, J.-F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Oper Res, 54, pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transport Res B-Meth, 37, pp. 579-594; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem: Models and algorithms (2007) Ann Oper Res, 153, pp. 29-46; Cullen, F., Jarvis, J., Ratliff, D., Set partitioning based heuristics for interactive routing (1981) Networks, 11, pp. 125-143; Czyzak, P., Jaszkiewicz, A., A multiobjective metaheuristic approach to the location of petrol stations by the capital budgeting model (1996) Control and Cybernetics, 25 (1), pp. 177-187. , Simulated Annealing Applied to Combinational Optimization; Czyzak, P., Jaszkiewicz, A., Pareto simulated annealing - A metaheuristic technique for multiple-objective combinatorial optimization (1998) J Multi-Crit Dec Anal, 7, pp. 34-47; Deb, K., Pratap, A., Agarwal, S., Meyarivan, T., A fast and elitist multi-objective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II (2002) IEEE T Evol Comput, 6, pp. 182-197; Diana, M., Dessouky, M.M., A new regret insertion heuristic for solving large-scale dial-a-ride problems with time windows (2004) Transport Res B-Meth, 38, pp. 539-557; Doerner, K.F., Gutjahr, W.J., Hartl, R.F., Strauss, C., Stummer, C., Pareto ant colony optimization: A metaheuristic approach to multi-objective portfolio selection (2004) Ann Oper Res, 131, pp. 79-99; Dumas, Y., Desrosiers, J., Soumis, F., Large scale multi- vehicle dial-a-ride problems (1989) Technical Report G-89-130, , HEC, Montréal, Canada; Ehrgott, M., Gandibleux, X., Approximative solution methods for multi-objective combinatorial optimization (2004) TOP, 12, pp. 1-89; Ehrgott, M., Tenfelde-Podehl, D., Computation of ideal and Nadir values and implications for their use in MCDM methods (2003) Eur J Oper Res, 151, pp. 119-139; Gandibleux, X., Mezdaoui, N., Fréville, A., A tabu search procedure to solve multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (1997) Lecture Notes in Economics and Mathematical Systems, MOPGP 1996, 455, pp. 291-300. , R.

This problem is to schedule dial-a-ride requests, where some part of each journey may be carried out by a fixed route service. The IDARP is a generalization of the Dial-a-Ride Problem. An arc-based formulation is proposed, and it is shown how the model can be made easier to solve by arc elimination, variable substitution and the introduction of subtour elimination constraints. Small instances of the IDARP can be solved using an exact solution method, and one such instance is studied. We also describe how input and output data can be created and visualized in a geographic information system. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",,"Dial-a-Ride; Dial-a-ride problem; Exact solution; Input and outputs; Variable substitution; Geographic information systems",,,,,"Aldaihani, M., Dessouky, M., Hybrid scheduling methods for paratransit operations (2003) Comput Ind Eng, 45, pp. 75-96; Attanasio, A., Cordeau, J., Ghiani, G., Laporte, G., Parallel tabu search heuristics for the dynamic multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2004) Parallel Comput, 30, pp. 377-387; Baugh, J., Kakivaya, G., Stone, J., Intractability of the dial-a-ride problem and a multiobjective solution using simulated annealing (1998) Eng Optim, 30, pp. 91-123; Bergvinsdottir, K., Larsen, J., Jorgensen, R., (2004) Solving the dial-a-ride problem using genetic algorithms, , Technical Report 2004-20, Informatics and Mathematical Modelling, Technical University of Denmark, Denmark; Börjesson, M., (2001) Erfarenheter av samordning av färdtjänst och sjukresor i Dalsland, , Vinnova Rapport 2001: 27; Borndörfer, R., Grötschel, M., Klostermeier, F., Küttner, C., Telebus Berlin: Vehicle scheduling in a dial-a-ride system (1997), Technical Report SC 97-23, Konrad-Zuse-Zentrum für Informationstechnik, Berlin; Chan, S., (2004) Metaheuristics for solving the dial-a-ride problem, , PhD Thesis, North Carolina State University, USA; Cordeau, J., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Oper Res, 54, pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transp Res Part B, 37, pp. 579-594; Diana, M., Dessouky, M., A new regret insertion heuristic for solving large-scale dial-a-ride problems with time windows (2004) Transp Res Part B, 38, pp. 539-557; Hickman, M., Blume, K., (2001) An investigation of integrated transit service, , Research Report SWUTC/01/472840-00023-1, Texas Transportation Institute, USA; Horn, M., Procedures for planning multi-leg journeys with fixed-route and demand-responsive passenger transport services (2004) Transp Res Part C, 12, pp. 33-55; Ioachim, I., Desrosiers, J., Dumas, Y., Solomon, M., Villeneuve, D., A request clustering algorithm for door-to-door handicapped transportation (1995) Transp Sci, 29, pp. 63-78; Jaw, J., Odoni, A., Psaraftis, H., Wilson, N., A heuristic algorithm for the multi-vehicle advance request dial-a-ride problem with time windows (1986) Transp Res Part B, 20, pp. 243-257; Liaw, C., White, C., Bander, J., A decision support system for the bimodal dial-a-ride problem (1996) IEEE Trans Syst Man Cybern Part A, 26, pp. 552-565; Madsen, O., Ravn, H., Rygaard, J.M., A heuristic algorithm for a dial-a-ride problem with time windows, multiple capacities, and multiple objectives (1995) Ann Oper Res, 60, pp. 193-208; Parragh, S., Doerner, K., Hartl, R., A survey on pickup and delivery problems: Part II: Transportation between pickup and delivery locations (2008) J Betriebswirtsch, 58, pp. 81-117; Psaraftis, H., A dynamic programming solution to the single vehicle many-to-many immediate request dial-a-ride problem (1980) Transp Sci, 14, pp. 130-154; Psaraftis, H., An exact algorithm for the single vehicle many-to-many dial-a-ride problem with time windows (1983) Transp Sci, 17, pp. 351-357; Ropke, S., Cordeau, J., Laporte, G., Models and branch-and-cut algorithms for pickup and delivery problems with time windows (2007) Networks, 49, pp. 258-272; Toth, P., Vigo, D., Heuristic algorithms for the handicapped persons transportation problem (1997) Transp Sci, 31, pp. 60-71; Uchimura, K., Takahashi, H., Saitoh, T., Demand responsive services in hierarchical public transportation system (2002) IEEE Trans Veh Technol, 51, pp. 760-766; Wilson, N., Sussman, J., Wang, H., Higonnet, B., (1971) Scheduling algorithms for dial-a-ride systems, , Technical Report USL-TR-71-13, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA; Wilson, N., Weissberg, R., Hauser, J., (1976) Advanced dial-a-ride algorithms research project: Final report, , Technical Report 76-20, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA","Häll, C.

This paper introduces a new branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm in which lower bounds are computed by solving through column generation the linear programming relaxation of a set partitioning formulation. Two pricing subproblems are considered in the column generation algorithm: an elementary and nonelementary shortest path problem. Valid inequalities are added dynamically to strengthen the relaxations. Some of the previously proposed inequalities for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows are also shown to be implied by the set partitioning formulation. Computational experiments indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms a recent branch-and-cut algorithm. © 2009 INFORMS.","Branch and cut; Branch and price; Column generation; Pickup and delivery; Valid inequalities","Costs; Graph theory; Linear programming; Pickups; Transportation routes; Branch and cut; Branch and price; Column generation; Pickup and delivery; Valid inequality; Integer programming",,,,,"Balas, E., Fischetti, M., Pulleyblank, W.R., The precedenceconstrained asymmetric traveling salesman polytope (1995) Math.

This paper proposes a solution method based on constraint programming and mathematical programming for a log-truck scheduling problem. The problem consists of scheduling the transportation of logs between forest areas and woodmills, as well as routing the fleet of vehicles to satisfy these transportation requests. The objective is to minimize the total cost of non-productive activities such as waiting time of trucks and forest log-loaders and the empty driven distance of vehicles. We propose a constraint programming model to address the combined scheduling and routing problem and an integer programming model to deal with the optimization of deadheads. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,"Constrained optimization; Forestry; Mathematical models; Mathematical programming; Scheduling; Forest log-loaders; Log-truck scheduling; Woodmills; Problem solving; Forestry; Problem Solving; Scheduling",,,,,"Baptiste, P., LePape, C., Nuijten, W., (2001) Constraint-Based Scheduling, , Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht; Gronalt, M., Hirsch, P., Log-Truck Scheduling with Tabu Search Strategy (2007) Metaheuristics, 39; Linnainmaa, S., Savalo, J., Jokinen, O., EPO: A knowledge based system for wood procurement management (1995) The 7th Annual Conference on Artifical Intelligence, , Montreal; Palmgren, M., Rönnqvist, M., Värbrand, P., A near-exact method for solving the logtruck scheduling problem (2004) International Transactions in Operational Research, 11, pp. 447-464; Rönnqvist, M., Optimization in forestry (2003) Mathematical Programming, 97, pp. 267-284; Ropke, S., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Models and Branch-and-Cut Algorithm for Pick-up and Delivery Problems with Time Windows (2007) Networks, 49 (4), pp. 258-272; Van Hentenryck, P., (1999) The OPL Optimization Programming Language, , MIT Press, Cambridge; Simonis, H., Charlier, P., Kay, P., Constraint Handling in an Integrated Transportation Problem (2000) IEEE Intelligent Systems and their Applications, 15 (1). , January; Weintraub, A., Epstein, R., Morales, R., Seron, J., Traverso, P., A truck scheduling system improves efficiency in the forest industries (1996) Interfaces, 26 (4), pp. 1-12","El Hachemi, N.; Interuniversity Research Centre on Enterprise Networks, Logistics and Transportation (CIRRELT), succursale centre-ville, Montreal, H3C 3J7, Canada; email: nizar@crt.umontreal.ca",,"Association for Constraint Programming;INRIA;Microsoft Research/INRIA Joint Center;National ICT Australia;ILOG",,"5th International Conference on Integration of AI and OR Techniques in Constraint Programming for Combinatorial Optimization Problems, CPAIOR 2008","20 May 2008 through 23 May 2008","Paris",72150,03029743,354068154X; 9783540681540,,,"English","Lect.

Basically, two problem classes can be distinguished. The first part dealt with the transportation of goods from the depot to linehaul customers and from backhaul customers to the depot. The second part now considers all those problems where goods are transported between pickup and delivery locations, denoted as Vehicle Routing Problems with Pickups and Deliveries (VRPPD). These are the Pickup and Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem (PDVRP - unpaired pickup and delivery points), the classical Pickup and Delivery Problem (PDP - paired pickup and delivery points), and the Dial-A-Ride Problem (DARP - passenger transportation between paired pickup and delivery points and user inconvenience taken into consideration). Single as well as multi vehicle mathematical problem formulations for all three VRPPD types are given, and the respective exact, heuristic, and metaheuristic solution methods are discussed. © Wirtschaftsuniversität Wien, Austria 2008.","Dial-a-ride problem; Pick up and delivery problem; Pickup and delivery vehicle routing; Survey; Transportation",,,,,,"Aldaihani, M., Dessouky, M.M., Hybrid scheduling methods for paratransit operations (2003) Comput Ind Eng, 45, pp. 75-96; Alfa, A.S., Scheduling of vehicles for transportation of elderly (1986) Transport Plan Tech, 11, pp. 203-212; Ambrosini, M., Caruso, T., Foresti, S., Righini, G., (2004) A GRASP for the Pickup and Delivery Problem With Rear Loading, , Tech.

Each request originates at one location and is destined for one other location. These requests apply to the transportation of goods or people, in which case the problem is often called the dial-a-ride problem. In recent years, there have been several significant developments in the area of exact and heuristic algorithms for PDPs. The purpose of this chapter is to report on these developments. It contains two main sections devoted to single vehicle and multi-vehicle problems, respectively.

The aim is to plan a set of m minimum cost vehicle routes capable of accommodating as many users as possible, under a set of constraints. The most common example arises in door-to-door transportation for elderly or disabled people. The purpose of this article is to review the scientific literature on the DARP.
