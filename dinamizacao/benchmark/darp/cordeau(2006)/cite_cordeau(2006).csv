To a high degree these needs can be fulfilled by individual and public transport. People that do not have access to the former and cannot use the latter require additional means of transportation. This is where dial-a-ride services come into play. The dial-a-ride problem considers transportation requests of people from pick-up to drop-off locations. Users specify time windows with respect to these points. Requests are served by a given vehicle fleet with limited capacity and tour duration per vehicle. Moreover, user inconvenience considerations are taken into account by limiting the travel time between origin and destination for each request. Previous research on the dial-a-ride problem primarily focused on serving a given set of requests with a fixed-size vehicle fleet at minimal traveling costs. It is assumed that the request set is sufficiently small to be served by the available vehicles. We consider a different scenario in which a maximal number of requests shall be served under the given constraints, i.e., it is no longer guaranteed that all requests can be accepted. For this new problem variant we propose a compact mixed integer linear programming model as well as algorithms based on Benders decomposition. In particular, we employ logic-based Benders decomposition and branch-and-check using mixed integer linear programming and constraint programming algorithms. We consider different variants on how to generate Benders cuts as well as heuristic boosting techniques and different types of valid inequalities. Computational experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the suggested algorithms. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Branch-and-check; Combinatorial Benders cuts; Dial-a-Ride problem; Logic-based Benders decomposition; Transportation","Computation theory; Computer circuits; Computer programming; Constraint theory; Fleet operations; Stochastic programming; Transportation; Travel time; Vehicles; Branch-and-check; Combinatorial Benders cuts; Computational experiment; Dial-a-ride problem; Logic-based benders decompositions; Means of transportations; Mixed integer linear programming; Mixed integer linear programming model; Integer programming",,,,,"Baklagis, D.G., Dikas, G., Minis, I., The team orienteering pick-up and delivery problem with time windows and its applications in fleet sizing (2016) RAIRO-Oper.

However, the cooperative GPDP may not be accepted by all the partners, as the cost of cooperative GPDP may be higher than that of the non-cooperative minimum cost PDP. Therefore, a reasonable compensation mechanism is desired to form an acceptable cooperative GPDP, and a fair method of profit distribution, based on the mechanism, is needed to stabilize the cooperation. In this paper, we analyze the situations in which a compensation is needed and develop the lower bound of the compensation. Further, we propose an exact method to calculate the actual compensation and the profit distribution based on cooperative game theory. The proposed exact method can efficiently solve the largest scale instance in Li & Lim benchmarks, i.e., pdptw1000-LR1_10_1 with 1,054 customers and 19,306 products. The proposed compensation and profit distribution mechanism based on cooperative game theory is also applied to a real-world GPDP and achieve satisfactory performance. Some interesting and important managerial insights are found and discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission; Compensation; Cooperation; Exact method; Pareto-optimal trip; Profit distribution","Compensation (personnel); Pareto principle; Pickups; Profitability; Carbon emissions; Cooperation; Exact methods; Pareto-optimal; Profit distributions; Game theory",,,,,"Barth, M., Younglove, T., Scora, G., Development of a Heavy-Duty Diesel Modal Emissions and Fuel Consumption Model (2005), California Partners for Advanced Transit and Highways; Barth, M., Boriboonsomsin, K., Real-world carbon dioxide impacts of traffic congestion (2008) Transp.

It proposes a simple yet practical framework for taxi ride-sharing and scheduling, to reduce waiting times and travel times during peak demand periods. The solution method helps taxi users save money while helping taxi drivers serve multiple requests per day, thus increasing their earnings. A comprehensive simulation study is conducted, based on real taxi booking data for the city of Singapore, to evaluate the effect of various factors of the ride-sharing practice, e.g., waiting time, extra travel time, and taxi fare reduction. The results demonstrate that ride-sharing could serve 20%–25% more taxi booking requests and reduce traveler waiting time during peak hours. It also indicates that there is a reduction in travel distance of approximately 2–3 km per taxi trip on average, which is approximately 20%–30% of the average ride distance. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,"Travel time; Origin and destinations; Ride-sharing; Simulation studies; Solution methods; Taxi drivers; Time of day; Travel distance; Waiting-time; Taxicabs; conceptual framework; simulation; taxi transport; transportation economics; travel time; urban transport; Singapore [Singapore (NTN)]; Singapore [Southeast Asia]",,,,,"Agatz, N., Erera, A., Savelsbergh, M., Wang, X., Optimization for dynamic ride-sharing: A review (2012) European Journal of Operational Research, 223 (2), pp. 295-303; Agatz, N.A., Erera, A.L., Savelsbergh, M.W., Wang, X., Dynamic ride-sharing: A simulation study in metro Atlanta (2011) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 45 (9), pp. 1450-1464. , Select Papers from the 19th {ISTTT}; Alonso-Mora, J., Samaranayake, S., Wallar, A., Frazzoli, E., Rus, D., On-demand high-capacity ride-sharing via dynamic trip-vehicle assignment (2017) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 114 (3), pp. 462-467; Bicocchi, N., Mamei, M., Investigating ride sharing opportunities through mobility data analysis (2014) Pervasive and Mobile Computing, 14, pp. 83-94. , Special Issue on Pervasive Education.

Planning daily PMC transport for ARG ships and nearby airfields is a unique vehicle routing problem characterized by a heterogeneous capacitated vehicle fleet, two cargo types, multiple depots, time windows, and synchronized routing of two aircraft required between some but not all node pairs. We formulate this problem as an integer linear program (ILP) with an objective function that expresses the cost of flight operations and a penalty for undelivered PMC. We perform extensive computational testing using an ILP solver and a tailored ant colony optimization with local search metaheuristic on test instances constructed to represent those found in practice. We find most instances difficult to solve optimally while our heuristic provides the best known or close to the best known solution in just a few minutes. We have embedded our heuristic in a decision support system complete with graphical user interface and sent this out for use by United States Navy ARG planners. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Ant colony optimization; Integer linear programming; Local search; Military; Vehicle routing",,,,,,"Barbarosoğlu, G., Özdamar, L., Cevik, A., An interactive approach for hierarchical analysis of helicopter logistics in disaster relief operations (2002) European Journal of Operational Research, 140 (1), pp. 118-133; Belanger, N., Desaulniers, G., Soumis, F., Desrosiers, J., Periodic airline fleet assignment with time windows, spacing constraints, and time dependent revenues (2006) European Journal of Operational Research, 175 (3), pp. 1754-1766; Bent, R., Van Hentenryck, P., A two-stage hybrid algorithm for pickup and delivery vehicle routing problems with time windows (2006) Computers & Operations Research, 33 (4), pp. 875-893; Braekers, K., Caris, A., Janssens, G.K., Exact and meta-heuristic approach for a general heterogeneous dial-a-ride problem with multiple depots (2014) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 67, pp. 166-186; Bredström, D., Rönnqvist, M., Combined vehicle routing and scheduling with temporal precedence and synchronization constraints (2008) European Journal of Operational Research, 191 (1), pp. 19-31; Brown, G.G., Carlyle, W.M., Dell, R.F., Optimizing intratheater military airlift in iraq and afghanistan (2013) Military Operations Research, 18 (3), pp. 35-52; Cherkesly, M., Desaulniers, G., Irnich, S., Laporte, G., Branch-price-and-cut algorithms for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows and multiple stacks (2016) European Journal of Operational Research, 250 (3), pp. 782-793; Cheung, R.K., Shi, N., Powell, W.B., Simao, H.P., An attribute-decision model for cross-border drayage problem (2008) Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 44 (2), pp. 217-234; Cordeau, J.-F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54 (3), pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem (darp): Variants, modeling issues and algorithms (2003) Quarterly Journal of the Belgian, French and Italian Operations Research Societies, 1 (2), pp. 89-101; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 37 (6), pp. 579-594; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem: Models and algorithms (2007) Annals of Operations Research, 153 (1), pp. 29-46; Dantzig, G.B., Ramser, J.H., The truck dispatching problem (1959) Management Science, 6 (1), pp. 80-91; De Rosa, B., Improta, G., Ghiani, G., Musmanno, R., The arc routing and scheduling problem with transshipment (2002) Transportation Science, 36 (3), pp. 301-313; Del Pia, A., Filippi, C., A variable neighborhood descent algorithm for a real waste collection problem with mobile depots (2006) International Transactions in Operational Research, 13 (2), pp. 125-141; Desaulniers, G., Desrosiers, J., Erdmann, A., Solomon, M.M., Soumis, F., Vrp with pickup and delivery (2002) SIAM Monographs on Discrete Mathematics and Applications, pp. 225-242; Desrosiers, J., Dumas, Y., Soumis, F., A dynamic programming solution of the large-scale single-vehicle dial—a-ride problem with time windows (1986) American Journal of Mathematical and Management Sciences, 6 (3-4), pp. 301-325; Detti, P., Papalini, F., de Lara, G.Z.M., A multi-depot dial-a-ride problem with heterogeneous vehicles and compatibility constraints in healthcare (2017) Omega, 70, pp. 1-14; Dorigo, M., Stützle, T., Ant colony optimization: Overview and recent advances (2010) Handbook of Metaheuristics, pp. 227-263. , M.

This paper presents a mathematical model to design an enhanced ridesharing system with meet points and users’ preferable time windows. The introduction of meet points allows ridesharing operators to trade off the benefits of saving en-route delays and the cost of additional walking for some passengers to be collectively picked up or dropped off. This extension to the traditional door-to-door ridesharing problem brings more operation flexibility in urban areas (where potential requests may be densely distributed in neighborhood), and thus could achieve better system performance in terms of reducing the total travel time and increasing the served passengers. We design and implement a Tabu-based meta-heuristic algorithm to solve the proposed mixed integer linear program (MILP). To evaluate the validation and effectiveness of the proposed model and solution algorithm, several scenarios are designed and also resolved to optimality by CPLEX. Results demonstrate that (i) detailed route plan associated with passenger assignment to meet points can be obtained with en-route delay savings; (ii) as compared to CPLEX, the meta-heuristic algorithm bears the advantage of higher computation efficiency and produces good quality solutions with 8%~15% difference from the global optima; and (iii) introducing meet points to ridesharing system saves the total travel time by 2.7%-3.8% for small-scale ridesharing systems. More benefits are expected for ridesharing systems with large size of fleet. This study provides a new tool to efficiently operate the ridesharing system, particularly when the ride sharing vehicles are in short supply during peak hours. Traffic congestion mitigation will also be expected. © 2018 Li et al.

The simulation engine is developed on top of the traffic simulation software Vissim. This software allows users to model several attributes of the traffic on the roads, thus, rendering a graphical illustration of vehicles serving on-demand customer requests. Upon being assigned the customer requests, the simulation engine executes the vehicle routing algorithm to direct the available fleet of vehicles to optimised routes to serve all the requests. The engine design follows a modular architecture that facilitates the addition of new software modules for advanced functionalities. Being generic in nature, this simulation platform can be used to simulate and validate different kinds of large scale vehicle routing algorithms. © 2017 IEEE.","fleet management system; on-demand mobility; Simulation platform","Computer software; Engines; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Machine design; Routing algorithms; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Design and Development; Fleet management system; Fleet of vehicles; Graphical illustrations; Modular architectures; On demands; Simulation platform; Traffic simulations; Fleet operations",,,,,"Pursula, M., Simulation of traffic systems-an overview (1999) Journal of Geographic Information and Decision Analysis, 3 (1), pp. 1-8; Helbing, D., Hennecke, A., Shvetsov, V., Treiber, M., Microand macro-simulation of freeway traffic (2002) Mathematical and Computer Modelling, 35 (5-6), pp. 517-547; Behrisch, M., Bieker, L., Erdmann, J., Krajzewicz, D., Sumo-simulation of urban mobility: An overview (2011) Proceedings of SIMUL 2011, the Third International Conference on Advances in System Simulation.

Each customer has a demand, characterized by a weight, and pickups and deliveries are performed by a single ship of given weight capacity. The ship is able to visit a port only if the amount of cargo it carries is compatible with the draft limit of the port. We present an integer linear programming formulation and we show how classical valid inequalities from the literature can be adapted to the considered problem.

When the items to be transported are people, it is necessary to simultaneously consider a minimization of operating costs (perspective of transportation systems managers) and a reduction of the inconveniences for the user. An unexpected failure of planned scheduling in the transport system (e.g. a failure in the engine of a train) may cause a service disruption to a large number of passengers who would remain isolated at origin stations. The result of that situation would be a scattered distributed population in points, with a heterogeneous demand in terms of destinations and specific requirements of service. In this paper, a model of transportation on-demand is formulated to address an incidence which happens in a transit line (metro, trains), forcing to reschedule the service in such transit lines. The goal is to minimize the total cost associated to the delay experienced by users who have to be served by an auxiliary fleet to attend this incidence. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Disruptions; Railways; Rescheduling","Information systems; Operating costs; Railroads; Supply chains; Disruptions; Heterogeneous demand; Pickup and delivery; Railways; Rescheduling; Service disruptions; Transportation system; Unexpected Failures; Transportation",,,,,"Arriola, R., Ortega, F.A., Pozo, M.A., Aplicación de los Problemas Pickup and Delivery en la Gestión de Emergencias de un Sistema de Ferrocarril (2009) Actas De Las II Jornadas Sobre Modelos De Optimización Aplicados a La Planificación Robusta Y La Gestión De Los Servicios De Transporte En Caso De Emergencia (MORE 2009), pp. 55-64. , Sevilla, España, ISBN-13:978-84-692-6689-2; Baldacci, R., Bartolini, E., Mingozzi, A., An exact algorithm for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2011) Oper.

A number of internet-based customized bus services have been planned and deployed for major origin-destination (OD) pairs to/from inner cities with limited physical road infrastructure. In this research, we aim to develop a joint optimization model for addressing a number of practical challenges for providing flexible public transportation services. First, how to maintain minimum loading rate requirements and increase the number of customers per bus for the bus operators to reach long-term profitability. Second, how to optimize detailed bus routing and timetabling plans to satisfy a wide range of specific user constraints, such as passengers’ pickup and delivery locations with preferred time windows, through flexible decision for matching passengers to bus routes. From a space-time network modeling perspective, this paper develops a multi-commodity network flow-based optimization model to formulate a customized bus service network design problem so as to optimize the utilization of the vehicle capacity while satisfying individual demand requests defined through space-time windows. We further develop a solution algorithm based on the Lagrangian decomposition for the primal problem and a space-time prism based method to reduce the solution search space. Case studies using both the illustrative and real-world large-scale transportation networks are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and its sensitivity under different practical operating conditions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Customized buses; Generalized assignment problem; Ridesharing; Space-time network; Vehicle routing problem","Bus transportation; Combinatorial optimization; Mass transportation; Optimization; Transportation; Transportation routes; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Generalized assignment problem; Large-scale transportation; Multi-commodity network flows; Practical operating conditions; Public transportation services; Ride-sharing; Space time; Vehicle Routing Problems; Buses; algorithm; bus transport; Lagrangian analysis; model; optimization; public transport; routing; transportation system",,,,,"Agatz, N.A., Erera, A.L., Savelsbergh, M.W., Wang, X., Dynamic ride-sharing: a simulation study in metro Atlanta (2011) Transp.

In the standard problem, operational costs are minimized, subject to full demand satisfaction and service level requirements. However, to enhance the practical applicability of solution methods, authors increasingly focus on problem variants that adopt additional real-life characteristics. First, this work introduces an up-to-date classification that distinguishes multiple categories of real-life characteristics. Second, the wide range of solution methods proposed in the literature is reviewed in a structured manner. Although the existing literature is reviewed exhaustively, specific attention is devoted to recent developments. Third, an extensive overview table provides full details on all problem characteristics and solution methods applied in each paper discussed. Fourth, lacunae in research conducted to date and opportunities for future work are identified. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Demand-responsive transportation; Dial-a-ride; Literature review;

In this paper, we investigate a new vehicle sharing system using AVs, referred to as autonomous vehicle sharing and reservation (AVSR). In such a system, travelers can request AV trips ahead of time and the AVSR system operator will optimally arrange AV pickup and delivery schedules and AV trip chains based on these requests. A linear programming model is proposed to efficiently solve for optimal solutions for AV trip chains and required fleet size through constructed AVSR networks. Case studies show that AVSR can significantly increase vehicle use rate (VUR) and consequentially reduce vehicle ownership significantly. In the meantime, it is found that the actual vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in AVSR systems is not significantly more than that of conventional taxis, despite inevitable empty hauls for vehicle relocation in AVSR systems. The results imply huge potential benefits from AVSR systems on improving mobility and sustainability of our current transportation systems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Autonomous vehicle (AV); Linear programming; Mobility and sustainability; Pickup and delivery; Vehicle miles traveled (VMT); Vehicle sharing and reservation (AVSR); Vehicle use rate (VUR)","Chains; Linear programming; Motor transportation; Pickups; Reservation systems; Sustainable development; Autonomous Vehicles; Linear programming models; Optimal solutions; Pickup and delivery; Potential benefits; Transportation system; Vehicle use; Vehicle-miles traveled; Vehicles; linear programing; mobility; ownership; sustainability; transportation planning; transportation technology; travel behavior; travel time",,,,,"Bansal, P., Kockelman, K.M., Singh, A., Assessing public opinions of and interest in new vehicle technologies: an Austin perspective (2016) Transp.

This paper investigates the operational effects of horizontal cooperation among dial-a-ride providers. The current practice is that users choose a particular provider to submit their requests. Providers operating in the same area create their routing solutions independently of each other, given their own set of customers. In contrast, horizontal cooperation through joint route planning implies that customer requests can be exchanged among providers in order to minimize the overall routing cost. In addition to quantifying the operational benefits generated by such a horizontal cooperation, this paper identifies operational characteristics that influence the magnitude of the savings. A real-life case study reveals the reasons why providers benefit from certain request exchanges, as well as the extent to which these exchanges are predictable in advance. The solutions are obtained using a large neighborhood search algorithm that performs well on benchmark data. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Demand-responsive transportation; Dial-a-ride services; Horizontal cooperation; Joint route planning",,,,,,"Anderson, D., Sweeney, D., Williams, T., Freeman, J., Shoesmith, E., Statistics for Business and Economics (2010), CENGAGE Learning Business Press; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Dynamic pickup and delivery problems (2010) Euro.

While some work has analyzed algorithmic performance relative to traditional min-sum or min-max objective functions and aesthetic objective functions, we are not aware of any work that has considered a multi-objective approach. This work considers a multi-objective variant of the Min-Max K-Vehicles Windy Rural Postman Problem, discusses several formulations of the problem, and presents computational experiments with a heuristic algorithm. After exploring several formulations, we choose to study the problem with a bi-objective function that includes contributions from the route overlap index and average task distance aesthetic measures. The heuristic extends the cluster-first procedure presented in Lum et al. (Networks 69 (2017), 290–303) by incorporating the new objective function into the improvement phase and adding a perturbation routine. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

SAVs essentially provide a dial-a-ride service to travelers, but the large number of vehicles involved (tens of thousands of SAVs to replace personal vehicles) results in SAV routing causing significant congestion. We combine the dial-a-ride service constraints with the linear program for system optimal dynamic traffic assignment, resulting in a congestion-aware formulation of the SAV routing problem. Traffic flow is modeled through the link transmission model, an approximate solution to the kinematic wave theory of traffic flow. SAVs interact with travelers at origins and destinations. Due to the large number of vehicles involved, we use a continuous approximation of flow to formulate a linear program. Optimal solutions demonstrate that peak hour demand is likely to have greater waiting and in-vehicle travel times than off-peak demand due to congestion. SAV travel times were only slightly greater than system optimal personal vehicle route choice. In addition, solutions can determine the optimal fleet size to minimize congestion or maximize service. © 2017","Dynamic traffic assignment; Shared autonomous vehicles; System optimal; Traffic flow","Linear programming; Traffic control; Transportation routes; Travel time; Vehicles; Approximate solution; Autonomous Vehicles; Continuous approximations; Dynamic traffic assignments; Kinematic-wave theory; Service constraints; System-optimal; Traffic flow; Traffic congestion; routing; traffic congestion; traffic management; transport vehicle; travel time",,,,,"Agatz, N., Erera, A., Savelsbergh, M., Wang, X., Optimization for dynamic ride-sharing: a review (2012) Eur.

The demand-adaptive service connects passengers from their origin/destination to the fixed-route service in order to improve accessability. The proposed hybrid design is unique in that it operates the demand-adaptive service with a stable headway to cover all stops along a paired fixed-route line. Pairing demand-adaptive vehicles with a fixed-route line simplifies the complexity of on-demand routing, because the vehicles can follow a more predictable path and can be dispatched on intervals coordinated with the fixed-route line. The design of the two services are closely coupled to minimize the total system cost, which incudes both the transit agency's operating cost and the user cost. The optimal design model is formulated as a mixed integer program and solved using a commercially available metaheuristic. Numerical experiments are conducted to compare the demand adaptive paired-line hybrid transit (DAPL-HT) system with two related transit systems that may be considered its special cases: a fixed-route system and a flexible-route system. We show that the DAPL-HT system outperforms the other two systems under a wide range of demand levels and in various scenarios of input parameters. A discrete-event simulation model is also developed and applied to confirm the correctness of the analytical results. © 2017","Demand adaptive service; Discrete-event simulation; Fixed-route service; Hybrid transit system","Costs; Integer programming; Mass transportation; Adaptive services; Analytical results; Discrete-event simulation model; Fixed-route service; Mixed-integer programs; Numerical experiments; Optimal design model; Transit systems; Discrete event simulation; analytical method; cost analysis; demand analysis; service quality; simulation; transportation system",,,,,"Aldaihani, M.M., Quadrifoglio, L., Dessouky, M.M., Hall, R., Network design for a grid hybrid transit service (2004) Transp.

The assumption of flexible depots allows the vehicle to end its route at any depot. As a result, the total travel cost may be reduced. A mixed integer nonlinear programming model was firstly formulated for the considered problem. To make the MHDARP-FD tractable, the original model was reformulated by linearizing constraints, aggregating variables, and strengthening model. The new model is solved by the state-of-the-art IP solver CPLEX. Computational results of numerical experiments show the validity of the proposed model and its effectiveness for addressing realistic problem. © 2017 IEEE.","Dial-a-ride problem; Flexible depots; Mixed integer programming; Multiple depots; Optimization","Finite difference method; Nonlinear programming; Optimization; Computational results; Dial-a-ride problem; Flexible depots; Heterogeneous vehicles; Mixed integer nonlinear programming models; Mixed integer programming; Multiple depot; Numerical experiments; Integer programming",,,,,"Wallace, R., Hughes-Cromwick, P., Mull, H., Cost-effectiveness of access to nonemergency medical transportation: Comparison of transportation and health care costs and benefits (2006) Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board, No. 1956, pp. 86-93; Psaraftis, H.N., A dynamic programming solution to the single vehicle many-to-many immediate request dial-a-ride problem (1980) Transportation Science, 14 (2), pp. 130-154; Psaraftis, H.N., An exact algorithm for the single vehicle many-to-many dial-a-ride problem with time windows (1983) Transportation Science, 17 (3), pp. 351-357; Dumas, Y., Desrosiers, J., Soumis, F., Large scale multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problems (1989) G-89-30, GERAD, HEC Montréal, , Montréal, Quebec, Canada, Tech.

Highly flexible, but very costly direct transportation is often offered as a complement to standard fixed route public transport service. In the integrated dial-a-ride problem (IDARP), these modes of transport are combined and certain legs of the passengers journeys may be performed with the fixed route public transport system. We extend the IDARP and include timetables for the fixed route services, forcing the fleet of vehicles to schedule the arrival at transfer locations with care. Two mixed integer linear programming formulations of the integrated dial-a-ride problem with timetables are presented and analyzed. The key modeling challenge is that of the transfers between the fleet of vehicles and the fixed route public transport system. The formulations differ in how the transfers are modeled and the differences are thoroughly discussed. The computational study compares the formulations in terms of network size, computational time and memory usage and conclusions about their performances are drawn. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Cost effectiveness;

This problem is motivated by a case study carried out in an oil company that operates in Brazil. Based on this study, we propose a mixed integer programming model that extends the classical pickup and delivery problem with time windows. This problem belongs to the NP-hard class and its solution is very challenging in practice. To model specific features of the addressed case, we include new constraints in the classical formulation, which makes it even more challenging for general purpose optimization solvers. To overcome this, we propose two branch-and-cut methods that use valid inequalities especially developed for the oil company case. Computational results performed with a real data set provided by the company show that the proposed branch-and-cut methods are effective and able to solve more instances than a state of the art general purpose optimization solver.","Branch-and-cut method; Oil industry; Pickup and delivery problem; Ship routing and scheduling",,,,,,"Andersson, H., Hoff, A., Christiansen, M., Hasle, G., Løkketangen, A., Industrial aspects and literature survey: Combined inventory management and routing (2010) Computers & Operations Research, 37 (9), pp. 1515-1536. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cor.2009.11.009; Balas, E., Fischetti, M., Pulleyblank, W.R., The precedence-constrained asymmetric travelling salesman polytope (1995) Mathematical Programming, 68 (1-3), pp. 214-265. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01585767; Baldacci, R., Bartolini, E., Mingozzi, A., An exact algorithm for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2011) Operations Research, 59 (2), pp. 414-426. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/opre.1100.0881; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.F., Gribkovskaia, I., Laporte, G., Static pickup and delivery problems: A classification scheme and survey (2007) Top, 15 (1), pp. 1-31. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11750-007-0009-0; (2011) Recuperado em 30 de Abril de 2012, , http://www.mdic.gov.br/sitio/, de; Brønmo, G., Nygreen, B., Lysgaard, J., Column generation approaches to ship scheduling with flexible cargo sizes (2010) European Journal of Operational Research, 200 (1), pp. 139-150. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2008.12.028; Christiansen, M., Decomposition of a combined inventory and time constrained ship routing problem (1999) Transportation Science, 33 (1), pp. 1-14. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/trsc.33.1.3; Christiansen, M., Fagerholt, K., Ronen, D., Ship routing and scheduling: Status and perspectives (2004) Transportation Science, 38 (1), pp. 1-18. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/trsc.1030.0036; Christiansen, M., Fagerholt, K., Ronen, D., Nygreen, B., Maritime transportation (2007) Handbook in Operations Research and Management Science, pp. 189-284. , C.

The problem presents several constraints and features, such as heterogeneous vehicles, vehicle–patient compatibility constraints, quality of service requirements, patients׳ preferences, tariffs depending on the vehicles׳ waiting. Variable Neighborhood Search and Tabu Search algorithms are proposed able to tackle all the characteristics of the problem. A Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulation is also presented.

Despite the potential to provide significant societal and environmental benefits, ridesharing has not so far been as popular as expected. Notable barriers include social discomfort and safety concerns when traveling with strangers. To overcome these barriers, in this paper, we propose a new type of Social-aware Ridesharing Group (SaRG) queries which retrieve a group of riders by taking into account their social connections and spatial proximities. While SaRG queries are of practical usefulness, we prove that, however, the SaRG query problem is NP-hard. Thus, we design an efficient algorithm with a set of powerful pruning techniques to tackle this problem. We also present several incremental strategies to accelerate the search speed by reducing repeated computations. Moreover, we propose a novel index tailored to our problem to further speed up query processing. Experimental results on real datasets show that our proposed algorithms achieve desirable performance. © 2015 IEEE.","group queries; Location-based services; query processing; ridesharing; social acquaintance","Query processing; Telecommunication services; Traffic congestion; Environmental benefits; group queries; Incremental Strategy; Metropolitan cities; Pruning techniques; Ride-sharing; social acquaintance; Spatial proximity; Location based services",,,,,"Agatz, N., Erera, A., Savelsbergh, M., Wang, X., Sustainable passenger transportation: Dynamic ridesharing (2009) Erasmus Research Inst.

Given the complexity of the problem, a novel unified model is formulated to decouple the interactions between the two decisions. Based on the unified model, some valid inequalities are derived and a tabu search algorithm is proposed.

Different from existing studies in ridesharing that focus on minimizing the travel costs of vehicles, we consider that the satisfaction of riders (the utility values) is more important nowadays. Thus, we formulate the problem of utility-aware ridesharing on road networks (URR) with the goal of providing the optimal rider schedules for vehicles to maximize the overall utility, subject to spatial-temporal and capacity constraints. To assign a new rider to a given vehicle, we propose an efficient algorithm with a minimum increase in travel cost without reordering the existing schedule of the vehicle. We prove that the URR problem is NP-hard by reducing it from the 0-1 Knapsack problem and it is unlikely to be approximated within any constant factor in polynomial time through a reduction from the DENS k-SUBGRAPH problem. Therefore, we propose three efficient approximate algorithms, including a bilateral arrangement algorithm, an efficient greedy algorithm and a grouping-based scheduling algorithm, to assign riders to suitable vehicles with a high overall utility. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our URR approaches on both real and synthetic data sets. © 2017 ACM.","Ridesharing; Task scheduling","Combinatorial optimization; Efficiency; Highway administration; Polynomial approximation; Roads and streets; Transportation; Vehicles; 0-1 knapsack problem; Approximate algorithms; Capacity constraints; Greedy algorithms; Ride-sharing; Subgraph problems; Synthetic datasets; Task-scheduling; Scheduling algorithms",,,,,"9th Dimacs Implementation Challenge - Shortest Paths, , http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/challenge9; Gowalla Check-in Dataset, , https://snap.stanford.edu/data/loc-gowalla.html; Lyft, , https://www.lytf.com; Apps See Surge in Riders Willing to Get Comfy with Strangers, , http://nypost.com/2016/08/13/apps-see-surge-in-riders-willing-to-get-comfy-with-stranger, online new york post news; Taxi Trip Data, , http://chriswhong.com/open-data/foil_nyc_taxi; Taxi Trips in City of Chicago Data Portal, , https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Taxi-Trips/wrvz-psew; Uber, , https://www.uber.com; Via, , https://www.via.com; Agresti, A., Kateri, M., (2011) Categorical Data Analysis, , Springer; Bayardo, R.J., Ma, Y., Srikant, R., Scaling up all pairs similarity search (2007) ACM WWW; Berger-Wolf, T.Y., Saia, J., A framework for analysis of dynamic social networks (2006) ACM SIGKDD; Cho, E., Myers, S.A., Leskovec, J., Friendship and mobility: User movement in location-based social networks (2011) ACM SIGKDD; Cordeau, J.-F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Research; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem (darp): Variants, modeling issues and algorithms (2003) Quarterly Journal of the Belgian, French and Italian Operations Research Societies; De Paepe, W.E., Lenstra, J.K., Sgall, J., Sitters, R.A., Stougie, L., Computer-aided complexity classification of dial-a-ride problems (2004) IJOC; D'Orey, P.M., Fernandes, R., Ferreira, M., Empirical evaluation of a dynamic and distributed taxi-sharing system (2012) ITSC.

Energy-efficient routing of such vehicles is of great interest for both financial and environmental sustainability. Given a multi-capacity RGV working on a linear track in AFHS, we consider its optimal routing under two-sided loading/unloading (TSLU) operations, in which energy consumption is minimized under conflict-avoidance and time window constraints. The energy consumption takes account of dynamics and routing-dependent gross weight of the RGV. And the conflict-avoidance constraints ensure conflict-free transport service under TSLU operations. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program, and solved by incorporating valid inequalities that exploit structural properties of the problem. The static problem model and solution approach are then integrated with a rolling-horizon approach to solve the dynamic routing problem where air cargo enters and departs from the system dynamically in time. Simulation results suggest that the proposed strategy is able to route a RGV to transport air cargo with an energy cost that is considerably lower than one of the most common heuristic methods implemented in current practice. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Conflict avoidance;

A hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) is proposed to solve the problem. Efficient construction heuristics, crossover operators and local search techniques, specifically tailored to the characteristics of the H-DARP, are provided. The proposed algorithm is tested on 92 benchmarks instances and 40 newly introduced larger instances. Computational experiments show the effectiveness of our approach compared to the current state-of-the-art algorithms for the DARP and H-DARP. When tested on the existing instances, we achieved average gaps of only 0.47% to the best-known solutions for the DARP, and 0.05% to the optimal solutions for the H-DARP, compared to 0.85% and 0.10%, respectively, obtained by the current state-of-the-art algorithms. For the 40 newly generated instances, average gaps of the hybrid GA are 0.35% smaller compared to the current state-of-the-art method. Besides, our method provides best results for 31 of these instances and ties with the existing method on 8 other instances. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Construction heuristics; Genetic Algorithm (GA); Heterogeneous Dial-A-Ride Problem (H-DARP); Hybrid algorithm; Local Search (LS)","Fleet operations; Local search (optimization); Problem solving; Transportation routes; Computational experiment; Construction heuristics; Dial-a-ride problem; Hybrid algorithms; Hybrid genetic algorithms; Local search; State-of-the-art algorithms; State-of-the-art methods; Genetic algorithms",,,,,"Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., Dynamic pickup and delivery problems (2010) Eur J Operat Res, 202 (1), pp. 8-15; Blanton, J.L., Jr, Wainwright, R.L., Multiple vehicle routing with time and capacity constraints using genetic algorithms (1993) Proceedings of the 5th international conference on genetic algorithms, pp. 452-459. , Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc; Borndorfer, R., Grotschel, M., Klostermeiner, F., Kuttner, C., Telebus Berlin: vehicle routing scheduling in a dial a ride system (1997), Konrad Zuse Zentrum für Information Technik Berlin; Braekers, K., Caris, A., Janssens, G.K., Exact and meta-heuristic approach for a general heterogeneous dial-a-ride problem with multiple depots (2014) Transport Res Part B: Methodological, 67, pp. 166-186; Buro, M., Experiments with Multi-ProbCut and a new high-quality evaluation function for Othello (1997) Games in AI Research, pp. 77-96; Chassaing, M., Duhamel, C., Lacomme, P., An ELS-based approach with dynamic probabilities management in local search for the Dial-A-Ride Problem (2016) Eng Appl Artif Intell, 48, pp. 119-133; Cao, E., Lai, M., An improved differential evolution algorithm for the vehicle routing problem with simultaneous delivery and pick-up service (2007) Third international conference on natural computation (ICNC 2007), 3, pp. 436-440. , IEEE; Choi, I.C., Kim, S.I., Kim, H.S., A genetic algorithm with a mixed region search for the asymmetric traveling salesman problem (2003) Comput Operat Res, 30 (5), pp. 773-786; Cordeau, J.F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operat Res, 54 (3), pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transport Res Part B: Methodological, 37 (6), pp. 579-594; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem: models and algorithms (2007) Ann Operat Res, 153 (1), pp. 29-46; Cubillos, C., Rodriguez, N., Crawford, B., A study on genetic algorithms for the DARP problem (2007) International work-conference on the interplay between natural and artificial computation, pp. 498-507. , Springer Berlin Heidelberg; Doerner, K., Salazar-Gonzalez, J., Vehicle routing: problems, methods, and applications, second edition.

To conduct a meaningful comparison, the optimal design problems for both systems are formulated using a same analytical framework based on the continuous approximation approach. A comprehensive numerical experiment is performed to compare various cost components corresponding to the optimal designs, and a discrete-event simulation model is developed to validate the analysis. The analytical and simulation results agree with each other well, with a discrepancy in the total system cost less than 5% in most test scenarios. These results also suggest that the line-based system consistently outperforms the zone-based system in terms of both agency and user costs, for all scenarios tested. Compared to the zone-based design, the line-based design features a sparser fixed-route network (resulting in larger stop spacing) but a higher dispatching frequency. It is concluded that the higher efficiency of the line-based design is likely derived from the strategy of operating e-hailing vehicles with a more regular route/headway structure and allowing ride-sharing. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Continuous approximation; Discrete-event simulation; E-hailing service; Fixed-route service; Relative spatial position","Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Light rail transit; Mass transportation; Optimal systems; Vehicles; Continuous approximations; Design features; Discrete-event simulation model; Fixed-route service; Higher efficiency; Numerical experiments; Spatial positions; Transit systems; Discrete event simulation; computer simulation; spatial analysis; transportation system",,,,,"Aldaihani, M.M., Quadrifoglio, L., Dessouky, M.M., Hall, R., Network design for a grid hybrid transit service (2004) Transp.

Because of the specific features of the system, in this paper we concentrate on its reliability and propose a model that aims at assigning requests to vehicles by minimizing the number of loading/unloading operations. We propose an integer linear programming formulation of such Stop Number Minimization Problem and examine the behavior of some of its variants. Next, we consider and analyze a set covering oriented reformulation of the model. Finally, we propose a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) based heuristic approach that implements insertion mechanisms and is well fitted to realistic dynamic contexts.

Quality is ensured by taking into account service level requirements. However, little research has been conducted into the effect of service level variations on operational costs incurred by service providers. This study investigates the evolution of operational costs for 78 combinations of two service level parameters, being the maximum deviation from a user’s preference time and the relative maximum exceedance of a user’s direct ride time. A distinction is made between various operating circumstances, including the size of the service provider, the traffic conditions in the service area and the heterogeneity of the customers. The resulting tradeoffs between quality and costs should encourage service providers to make informed decisions regarding potential changes in the service level they offer. The sensitivity analysis in this paper is performed on well-known benchmark data from literature and applies a state-of-the-art deterministic annealing metaheuristic to compute operational costs. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Demand-responsive transportation; Deterministic annealing; Dial-a-ride; Operational costs; Service level",,,,,,"Anderson, D.R., Sweeney, D.J., Williams, T.A., Freeman, J., Shoesmith, E., (2010) Statistics for business and economics, , CENGAGE Learning Business Press, Boston; Ben-Akiva, M., Benjamin, J., Lauprete, G.J., Polydoropoulou, A., Impact of advanced public transportation systems on travel by dial-a-ride (1996) Transp Res Rec, 1557, pp. 72-79; Braekers, K., Caris, A., Janssens, G.K., Exact and meta-heuristic approach for a general heterogeneous dial-a-ride problem with multiple depots (2014) Transp Res Part B: Methodol, 67, pp. 166-186; Cordeau, J.-F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Oper Res, 54 (3), pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J.-F., Gendreau, M., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for periodic and multi-depot vehicle routing problems (1997) Networks, 30, pp. 105-119; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transp Res Part B: Methodol, 37 (6), pp. 579-594; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem: models and algorithms (2007) Ann Oper Res, 153 (1), pp. 29-46; Cubillos, C., Paolo, F., Mascia, M., Zunino, C., On user requirements and operator purposes in dial-a-ride services (2002) Proceedings of the 9th meeting of the EURO working group on transportation; Jaw, J.-J., Odoni, A.R., Psaraftis, H.N., Wilson, N.H.M., A heuristic algorithm for the multi-vehicle advance-request dial-a-ride problem with time windows (1986) Transp Res Part B: Methodol, 20, pp. 243-257; Lin, S., Kernighan, B.W., An effective heuristic algorithm for the traveling salesman problem (1973) Oper Res, 21 (2), pp. 498-516; Marković, N., Nair, R., Schonfeld, P., Miller-Hooks, E., Mohebbi, M., Optimizing dial-a-ride services in maryland.

These services present enormous potential for positive societal impacts with respect to pollution, energy consumption, congestion, etc. Current mathematical models, however, do not fully address the potential of ride-sharing. Recently, a largescale study highlighted some of the benefits of car pooling but was limited to static routes with two riders per vehicle (optimally) or three (with heuristics).We present a more general mathematical model for real-time high-capacity ride-sharing that (i) scales to large numbers of passengers and trips and (ii) dynamically generates optimal routes with respect to online demand and vehicle locations. The algorithm starts from a greedy assignment and improves it through a constrained optimization, quickly returning solutions of good quality and converging to the optimal assignment over time. We quantify experimentally the tradeoff between fleet size, capacity, waiting time, travel delay, and operational costs for low- to medium-capacity vehicles, such as taxis and van shuttles. The algorithm is validated with ~3 million rides extracted from the New York City taxicab public dataset. Our experimental study considers ride-sharing with rider capacity of up to 10 simultaneous passengers per vehicle. The algorithm applies to fleets of autonomous vehicles and also incorporates rebalancing of idling vehicles to areas of high demand. This framework is general and can be used for many real-time multivehicle, multitask assignment problems.","Human mobility; Intelligent transportation systems; Ride-sharing; Smart cities; Vehicle routing","algorithm; Conference Paper; experimental study; human; mathematical model; motor vehicle; New York; priority journal; time; travel; validation process",,,,,"Schrank, D., Eisele, B., Lomax, T., (2012) Texas Transportation Institute 2012 Urban Mobility Report, , (Texas Transportation Institute, A&M University, College Station, TX); Pant, P., Harrison, R.M., Estimation of the contribution of road traffic emissions to particulate matter concentrations from field measurements: A review (2013) Atmos Environ, 77, pp. 78-97; Carrion, C., Levinson, D., Value of travel time reliability: A review of current evidence (2012) Transp Res Part A Policy Pract, 46 (4), pp. 720-741; Hennessy, D.A., Wiesenthal, D.L., Traffic congestion, driver stress, and driver aggression (1999) Aggress Behav, 25 (6), pp. 409-423; Santi, P., Quantifying the benefits of vehicle pooling with shareability networks (2014) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 111 (37), pp. 13290-13294; Pavone, M., Smith, S.L., Frazzoli, E., Rus, D., Robotic load balancing for mobility-ondemand systems (2012) Int J Rob Res, 31 (7), pp. 839-854; Zhang, R., Pavone, M., Control of robotic mobility-on-demand systems: A queueing-theoretical perspective (2014) Proceedings of Robotics: Science and Systems Conference, , July 12-16, 2014, Berkeley, CA; Spieser, K., Toward a systematic approach to the design and evaluation of automated mobility-on-demand systems: A case study in Singapore (2014) Road Vehicle Automation, pp. 229-245. , Springer International Publishing, Cham, Switzerland; Spieser, K., Samaranayake, S., Gruel, W., Frazzoli, E., Shared-vehicle mobility-ondemand systems: A fleet operator's guide to rebalancing empty vehicles (2016) Transportation Research Board 95th Annual Meeting, , January 10-14, 2016, Washington, DC, abstr 16-5987; De Almeida Correia, G.H., Van Arem, B., Solving the user optimum privately owned automated vehicles assignment problem (UO-POAVAP): A model to explore the impacts of self-driving vehicles on urban mobility (2016) Transp Res Part B Methodological, 87, pp. 64-88; Toth, P., Vigo, D., (2014) Vehicle Routing: Problems, Methods, and Applications, 18. , SIAM, Philadelphia; Pillac, V., Gendreau, M., Guéret, C., Medaglia, A.L., A review of dynamic vehicle routing problems (2013) Eur J Oper Res, 225 (1), pp. 1-11; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., Dynamic pickup and delivery problems (2010) Eur J Oper Res, 202 (1), pp. 8-15; Golden, B.L., Raghavan, S., Wasil, E.A., (2008) The Vehicle Routing Problem: Latest Advances and New Challenges, 43. , Springer Science & Business Media, Berlin; Stenger, A., Vigo, D., Enz, S., Schwind, M., An adaptive variable neighborhood search algorithm for a vehicle routing problem arising in small package shipping (2013) Transport Sci, 47 (1), pp. 64-80; Agatz, N.A.H., Erera, A.L., Savelsbergh, M.W.P., Wang, X., Dynamic ride-sharing: A simulation study in metro Atlanta (2011) Transp Res Part B Meth, 45 (9), pp. 1450-1464; Horn, M.E.T., Fleet scheduling and dispatching for demand-responsive passenger services (2002) Transp Res Part C Emerg Technol, 10 (1), pp. 35-63; Ma, S., Zheng, Y., Wolfson, O., T-share: A large scale dynamic taxi ridesharing service (2013) 2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE), pp. 410-421. , (IEEE, Piscataway, NJ); Cordeau, J.F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Oper Res, 54 (3), pp. 573-586; Helsgaun, K., An effective implementation of the Lin-Kernighan traveling salesman heuristic (2000) Eur J Oper Res, 126 (1), pp. 106-130; Glover, F., Laguna, M., (2013) Tabu Search?, , Springer, Berlin; Pham, D.T., Karaboga, D., (2012) Intelligent Optimisation Techniques: Genetic Algorithms Tabu Search Simulated Annealing and Neural Networks, , Springer Science & Business Media, Berlin; Donovan, B., Work, D.B., (2015) Using Coarse GPS Data to Quantify City-scale Transportation System Resilience to Extreme Events, , arXiv: 1507.06011","Alonso-Mora, J.; Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyUnited States; email: J.AlonsoMora@tudelft.nl",,,"National Academy of Sciences",,,,,00278424,,PNASA,,"English","Proc.

This problem is formulated as the real-world DARP, and two methods are empirically evaluated by using Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) frameworks.

This mode allows passengers to be carried to their destinations through a set of transportation requests established by customers. These requests are to be answered by a single depot with different vehicle configurations. The idea is to group a number of passengers in the same vehicle respecting of the capacity of each vehicle in order to reduce the operational cost while maintaining a good quality of service. In this paper, we treated the static case of demand responsive transport problem. A new mathematical model for this problem is presented aiming to optimise the cost and the quality of service. This model integrates an original concept; penalty concept to enhance the quality of service. The model is validated on small and medium size instances.

This paper is focused in the Vehicle Routing Problem with Demand Responsive Transport (VRPDRT), a type of transport which enables passengers to be taken to their destination, as a shared service, trying to minimize the company costs and offer a quality service taking passengers on their needs. A manyobjective approach is applied in VRPDRT in which seven different objective functions are used. To solve the problem through traditional multiobjective algorithms, the work proposes the usage of cluster analysis to perform the dimensionaly reduction task. The seven functions are then aggregated resulting in a bi-objective formulation and the algorithms NSGA-II and SPEA 2 are used to solve the problem. The results show that the algorithms achieve statistically different results and NSGA-II reaches a greater number of non-dominated solutions when compared to SPEA 2. Furthermore, the results are compared to an approach proposed in literature that uses another way to reduce the dimensionality of the problem in a two-objective formulation and the cluster analysis procedure is proven to be a competitive methodology in that problem. It is possbile to say that the behavior of the algorithm is modified by the way the dimensionality reduction of the problem is made. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Cluster analysis; Demand responsive transport; Dimensinality reduction; Many-objective optimization; Vehicle routing problem","Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Evolutionary algorithms; Optimization; Reduction; Transportation; Urban transportation; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Demand responsive transport; Demand responsive transport systems; Dimensionality reduction; Many-objective optimizations; Multi objective algorithm; Nondominated solutions; Urban transport systems; Vehicle Routing Problems; Problem solving",,,,,"Balcan, M.F., Blum, A., Vempala, S., A discriminative framework for clustering via similarity functions (2008) Proceedings of the 40Th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing; Chevrier, R., Liefooghe, A., Jourdan, L., Dhaenens, C., Solving a dial-a-ride problem with a hybrid evolutionary multi-objective approach: Application to demand responsive transport (2012) Appl.

It studies the impact of combination restrictions, preventing particular user combinations and limiting the set of drivers to which particular users can be assigned. The academic literature currently lacks insights into the effect of these restrictions on the cost structure of a service provider. A multi-directional local search algorithm is developed to solve this problem, taking into account the fundamental tradeoff between operational efficiency and service quality. Local search is integrated into a variable neighborhood descent framework that applies an intelligent candidate list principle to reduce computation time. Moreover, a new scheduling procedure is proposed, constructing time schedules that minimize total user ride time. It proves to be faster and more efficient than existing scheduling procedures. Overall, computational experiments on existing benchmark data extended with combination restrictions reveal a general pattern in the effect of the combination restrictions. Such insights are essential for service providers in order to support policy choices, e.g. related to service quality or medical education of drivers. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Bi-objective optimization;

Although some recommendation systems have proposed taxicab carpooling services recently, they cannot fully utilize and understand the known information and essence of carpooling. This study proposes a novel recommendation algorithm, which provides either a vacant or an occupied taxicab in response to a passenger’s request, called VOT. VOT recommends the closest vacant taxicab to passengers. Otherwise, VOT infers destinations of occupied taxicabs by similarity comparison and clustering algorithms and then recommends the occupied taxicab heading to a close destination to passengers. Using an efficient large data-processing framework, Spark, we greatly improve the efficiency of large data processing. This study evaluates VOT with a real-world dataset that contains 14747 taxicabs’ GPS data. Results show that the ratio of range (between forecasted and actual destinations) of less than 900M can reach 90.29%. The total mileage to deliver all passengers is significantly reduced (47.84% on average). Specifically, the reduced total mileage of nonrush hours outperforms other systems by 35%. VOT and others have similar performances in actual detour ratio, even better in rush hours. © 2017 Pengpeng Chen et al.",,"Clustering algorithms; Data handling; Recommender systems; Traffic congestion;

Although there exist exact algorithms for tackling this problem, they are still difficult to apply in massively large practical scheduling scenarios due to their time complexities. Hence, the approximate methods became the main stream of research in this field. In this paper, we propose an adaptive guided ejection search algorithm for solving the pickup and delivery with time windows. The pivotal part of this technique is the pre-processing step, in which the instance characteristics concerning its underlying structure are extracted in the clustering and histogram-based analyses. Then, the k-nearest neighbor algorithm is applied to classify the instance to an appropriate class. Finally, the most suitable variant of our enhanced guided ejection search algorithm is adaptively chosen for solving this instance based on the classification outcome. An extensive experimental study performed on the full Li and Lim's benchmark (encompassing 354 problem instances belonging to 6 classes) revealed that our pre-processing allows for achieving very high classification accuracy, thus for selecting the best variant of the enhanced guided ejection search. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

In big data era, dynamic ride sharing, powered by mobile computation, location based service, and social networks, emerges and gains popularities recently for providing real-time and flexible ride sharing services through real-time travel planning systems. These systems raise research opportunities as well as challenges, including how to process real-time location data and traffic data, to match ride requests and cars in real time, and to provide fair, secure, and low-priced services to gain more participants. This paper defines the problem of dynamic ride sharing formally and discusses its variants and recent developments. The framework of filter and refine to solve the real-time challenges of matching requests and cars is then discussed. In particular, in the filter step, we introduce the method of pre-computing, spatio-temporal index, grouping, and parallelizing. In the refine step, we introduce the method of lazy calculation strategy, new index tree structure, and evolutionary computation. We also discuss the techniques related to social factors such as pricing strategies, credit system, human-computer interaction, and security in big data era. Finally, this paper ends with a panoramic summary and a discussion on possible future research directions. © 2017, Science Press.

The problem is modeled as a multitrip pickup and delivery problem with time windows and manpower planning (MTPDPTW-MP) that not only needs to design and schedule ambulance routes satisfying a series of constraints but also requires staff scheduling. Because of the strict limits on route duration, each ambulance traverses several routes per day, which, starting and terminating at the depot, complete a series of pickup and delivery operations to serve the clients. A feasible route demands a driver and several assistants to serve the clients and needs to satisfy some constraints, such as capacity, pickup before delivery, time windows, etc. The objective is hierarchical in that it primarily serves as many clients as possible, then minimizes the operational cost, and finally strikes a balance for the staff workload. Theoretically, MTPDPTW-MP, which is a combination of two well known NP-hard problems (i.e., the pickup and delivery problem with time windows and the staff scheduling problem), is difficult to solve. In this study, we propose an iterated local search metaheuristic that uses a variable neighborhood descent procedure in the local search phase.We use a modified regret insertion method to construct solutions; a heuristic backtracking algorithm is designed to schedule staff. To speed up the process,we adapt the segment-based evaluation for moves and reduce the neighborhoods explored based on the characteristics of the problem. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was tested in real-world instances. Results showed that it can serve more requests than the manually designed plans. In addition, the performance of the proposed algorithm was evaluated on a simplified problem: the multitrip vehicle routing problem with time windows. © 2016 INFORMS.","Healthcare transportation; Iterated local search; Manpower planning; Pickup and delivery problem with time windows; Variable neighborhood descent","Ambulances; Computational complexity; Health care; Heuristic methods; Hospitals; Local search (optimization); Pickups; Planning; Scheduling; Vehicle routing; Backtracking algorithm; Iterated local search; Manpower planning; Pick-up and delivery service; Pickup and delivery problem with time windows; Transportation services; Variable neighborhood descents; Vehicle routing problem with time windows; Constraint satisfaction problems",,,,,"Alonso, F., Alvarez, M.J., Beasley, J.E., A tabu search algorithm for the periodic vehicle routing problem with multiple vehicle trips and accessibility restrictions (2007) J.

Recently, several extensions have been proposed towards more realistic applications of the problem. In this paper, a new variant called the Multi-Depot Multi-Trip Heterogeneous Dial-a-Ride Problem (MD-MT-HDARP) is considered. A mathematical programming formulation and three metaheuristics are proposed: an improved Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS), Hybrid Bees Algorithm with Simulated Annealing (BA-SA), and Hybrid Bees Algorithm with Deterministic Annealing (BA-DA). Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for solving the underlying problem. In addition, they are competitive to the current state-of-the-art algorithm on the MD-HDARP. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Bees Algorithm (BA); Dial-a-Ride Problem (DARP); Metaheuristic; Optimization; Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)","algorithm; annealing; heterogeneity; optimization; software; transportation system; Apoidea",,,,,"Borndörfer, R., Grötschel, M., Klostermeier, F., Küttner, C., Telebus Berlin: Vehicle Scheduling in a Dial-a-Ride System (1999), pp. 391-422. , Springer Berlin Heidelberg; Braekers, K., Caris, A., Janssens, G.K., Integrated planning of loaded and empty container movements (2013) OR Spectrum, 35 (2), pp. 457-478; Braekers, K., Caris, A., Janssens, G.K., Exact and meta-heuristic approach for a general heterogeneous dial-a-ride problem with multiple depots (2014) Transport.

Typically, several users with different pickup and dropoff locations are transported on a vehicle simultaneously. The focus in dial-a-ride problems (DARPs) is mainly on minimizing routing cost. Service quality has been taken into account in the models by imposing time windows and limiting the maximum ride time of each user. We extend the classical DARP by an additional feature of service quality referred to as driver consistency. Customers of dial-a-ride services are often sensitive to changes in their daily routine. This aspect includes the person who is providing the transportation service, i.e., the driver of the vehicle. Our problem, called the driver consistent dial-a-ride problem (DC-DARP), considers driver consistency by bounding the maximum number of different drivers that transport a user over a multi-period planning horizon. We propose different formulations of the problem and examine their efficiency when applied in a Branch-and-Cut fashion. Additionally, we develop a large neighborhood search algorithm that generates near-optimal solutions in a short amount of time. Over 1000 instances are generated with close reference to real world scenarios. Extensive computational experiments are conducted in order to assess the quality of the solution approaches and to provide insights into the new problem. Results reveal that the cost of offering driver consistency varies greatly in magnitude. Depending on the instance, the cost of assigning one driver to each user can be up to 27.98% higher compared to a low-cost solution. However, routing cost increases by not more than 5.80% if users are transported by at least two drivers. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Branch-and-Cut; Dial-a-ride problem; Driver consistency; Large neighborhood search; Multiple periods","Integer programming; Optimization; Quality of service; Branch and cut; Dial-a-ride problem; Driver consistency; Large neighborhood search; Multiple periods; Costs; algorithm; disability; elderly population; neighborhood; service quality",,,,,"Amirgholy, M., Gonzales, E., Demand responsive transit systems with time-dependent demand: user equilibrium, system optimum, and management strategy (2016) Transp.

Thus, the oil companies transport its employees by helicopters between onshore basins, airports and platforms. This problem is known as the Capacitated Helicopter Routing Problem (CHRP). In this paper, it is proposed a formal mathematical model to the CHRP with several specific constraints and a more realistic objective function. Besides a Clustering Search (CS) metaheuristic is proposed to solve it. The mathematical model and the CS metaheuristic were tested with real data from a Brazilian oil and gas company. A set of instances with up to 1000 transportation requests and 100 helicopters was generated. Computational experiments indicate that CPLEX is not able to solve optimally even small instances of the problem, but the CS metaheuristic is capable of solving the proposed model generating good, stable and fast solutions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Capacitated Helicopter Routing Problem; Clustering Search; Oil and gas logistics","Functions; Gas industry; Helicopters; Offshore drilling; Offshore oil wells; Oil well drilling; Production platforms; Public utilities; Clustering Search; Computational experiment; Fast solutions; Objective functions; Oil and gas; Oil and gas companies; Oil companies; Routing problems; Petroleum transportation",,,,,"(2012), ().

Efficient ridesharing solutions could help mitigate congestion. Some of the actions that government agencies have taken to encourage ridesharing include the availability of high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes and existing policies of discounted toll rates on HOVs. These measures encourage ridesharing by reducing costs or travel times of such trips. To study how the optimal routes change as a function of incentives for ridesharing, we modified existing pickup and delivery problems with time windows to consider changes in passenger travel time and toll cost due to vehicle load. Our computational results explore how the total route cost and time are affected by the use of HOV lanes and toll savings. In addition, our results show that it can be beneficial from a time and cost perspective to take detours to pick up additional passengers and use HOV lanes when the time saving on HOV lanes is significant. © 2016 W.

The U-DSS architecture is proposed by describing its main components. In particular, this paper focuses on the core of the U-DSS, i.e., the model component that provides the solutions of a general vehicle assignment and routing optimization problem with the aim of minimizing the length of the routes and satisfying time and capacity constraints. In order to solve the vehicle routing problems in reasonable time, a two-phase heuristic algorithm is proposed based on a clustering strategy and a farthest insertion heuristic for the solution of a traveling salesman problem. The applicability of the proposed U-DSS is enlightened by comparing the proposed heuristic algorithm solutions with the mixed integer linear programming problem solutions of the PD and WC services. Moreover, the discussion of the real case studies of the city of Bari (Italy) assesses the proposed approach. © 2016 IEEE.","Decision support system (DSS); heuristic algorithms; logistics; vehicle routing problem (VRP)","Artificial intelligence; Constraint satisfaction problems; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic programming; Integer programming; Optimization; Postal services; Traveling salesman problem; Vehicle routing; Capacity constraints; Clustering strategy; Mixed integer linear programming problems; Routing optimization; Two-phase heuristic algorithm; Unified framework; Vehicle assignment; Vehicle Routing Problems; Decision support systems",,,,,"Kim, G., Ong, Y.-S., Heng, C.K., Tan, P.S., Zhang, N.A., City vehicle routing problem (City VRP): A review (2015) IEEE Trans.

Moreover, in a shift the vehicle can perform several routes subject to time and capacity constraints. Our aim is supporting the decision maker in planning the optimal vehicle routes with the objective of minimizing the length of the travels while collecting all the daily waste. The Waste Collection Vehicle Routing Problem (WCVRP) is modelled as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming problem with shift and time constraints. In order to address the large dimension of the considered city street networks, we propose a heuristic algorithm based on a clustering strategy and a farthest insertion heuristic for the solution of the Traveling Salesman Problem. A set of tests and a case study show the effectiveness of the proposed heuristic algorithm to plan the waste collection in a work day of an Italian city. © 2016 American Automatic Control Council (AACC).",,,,,,,"Karadimas, N.V., Optimal solid waste collection routes identified by the ant colony system algorithm (2007) Waste Management & Research, 25 (2), pp. 139-147; Junger, M., Reinelt, G., Rinaldi, G., The traveling salesman problem (1995) Handbooks in Operations Research and Management Science, 7. , Network Models, North-Holland Elsevier; Cook, W., The traveling salesman problem and optimization on a grand scale (2003) SIAM Annual Meeting, , Montreal, June 18; Fan, X., Zhu, M., Zhang, X., He, Q., Rovetta, A., Solid waste collection optimization considering energy utilization for large city area (2010) International Conference on Logistics Systems and Intelligent Management, pp. 1905-1909; Zhu, Z., Xia, M., Yang, Y., Li, X., Deng, X., Xie, Z., An improved genetic algorithm for the extended Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (2008) 7th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation, pp. 2017-2022; Singh, A.P., Ruhe, G., Amereei, S.A.H., Banack, S., Decision support for capacitated arc routing for providing municipal waste and recycling services (2014) 47th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS), pp. 986-993; Liu, J., He, Y., Zhang, A., An improved MULTI-ACS algorithm for the waste collection vehicle arc routing problem with turn constraints (2014) Tenth International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security (CIS), pp. 25-29; Islam, R., Rahman, M.S., An ant colony optimization algorithm for waste collection vehicle routing with time windows, driver rest period and multiple disposal facilities (2012) 2012 International Conference on Informatics, Electronics & Vision (ICIEV), pp. 774-779; Liu, J., He, Y., Ant colony algorithm for waste collection vehicle arc routing problem with turn constraints (2012) 2012 Eighth International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security (CIS), pp. 35-39; Vonolfen, S., Affenzeller, M., Beham, A., Wagner, S., Lengauer, E., Simulation-based evolution of municipal glass-waste collection strategies utilizing electric trucks (2011) 3rd IEEE International Symposium on Logistics and Industrial Informatics (LINDI), pp. 177-182; Cordeau, J.F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operation Research, 54, pp. 573-586; http://glpkmex.sourceforge.net/; Kim, B.-I., Kim, S., Sahoo, S., Waste collection vehicle routing problem with time windows (2006) Computers & Operation Research, 33, pp. 3624-3642; Tung, D.V., Pinnoi, A., Vehicle routing-scheduling for waste collection in Hanoi (2000) European Journal of Operational Research, 125, pp. 449-468",,,"Adaptics;et al.;GE Global Research;MathWorks;Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratory (MERL);Quanser","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2016 American Control Conference, ACC 2016","6 July 2016 through 8 July 2016",,123142,07431619,9781467386821,PRACE,,"English","Proc Am Control Conf",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992073884

This paper first proposes a new time-discretized multi-commodity network flow model for the VRPPDTW based on the integration of vehicles' carrying states within space-time transportation networks, so as to allow a joint optimization of passenger-to-vehicle assignment and turn-by-turn routing in congested transportation networks. Our three-dimensional state-space-time network construct is able to comprehensively enumerate possible transportation states at any given time along vehicle space-time paths, and further allows a forward dynamic programming solution algorithm to solve the single vehicle VRPPDTW problem. By utilizing a Lagrangian relaxation approach, the primal multi-vehicle routing problem is decomposed to a sequence of single vehicle routing sub-problems, with Lagrangian multipliers for individual passengers' requests being updated by sub-gradient-based algorithms. We further discuss a number of search space reduction strategies and test our algorithms, implemented through a specialized program in C++, on medium-scale and large-scale transportation networks, namely the Chicago sketch and Phoenix regional networks. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Forward dynamic programming; Lagrangian relaxation; Ride-sharing service optimization; Time-dependent least-cost path problem; Vehicle routing problem with pickup and delivery with time windows","C++ (programming language); Complex networks; Computer software; Lagrange multipliers; Network routing; Optimization; Pickups; Routing algorithms; Software testing; Time sharing systems; Transportation; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; LaGrangian relaxation; Large-scale transportation; Least cost path; Multi-commodity network flow models; Pick-up and delivery service; Pickup and delivery; Service optimization; Vehicle Routing Problems; Dynamic programming; algorithm; congestion; Lagrangian analysis; network analysis; optimization; transportation system",,,,,"Alfa, A.S., Scheduling of vehicles for transportation of elderly (1986) Transportation Planning and Technology, 11, pp. 203-212; Azi, N., Gendreau, M., Potvin, J.Y., An exact algorithm for a single vehicle routing problem with time windows and multiple routes (2007) European Journal of Operational Research, 178 (3), pp. 755-766; Baldacci, R., Bartolini, E., Mingozzi, A., An exact algorithm for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2011) Operations Research, 59 (2), pp. 414-426; Bell, W., Dalberto, L., Fisher, M.L., Greenfield, A., Jaikumar, R., Kedia, P., Mack, R., Prutzman, P., Improving the distribution of industrial gases with an on-line computerized routing and scheduling optimizer (1983) Interfaces, 13, pp. 4-23; Bellman, R., Dynamic programming treatment of the traveling salesman problem (1962) Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery, 9, pp. 61-63; Bodin, L.D., Sexton, T., The multi-vehicle subscriber dial-a-ride problem (1986) TIMS Studies in the Management Sciences, 22, pp. 73-86; Bramel, J., Simchi-Levi, D., A location based heuristic for general routing problems (1995) Operations Research, 43, pp. 649-660; Chabini, I., Discrete dynamic shortest path problems in transportation applications: Complexity and algorithms with optimal run time (1998) Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board, 1645, pp. 170-175; Chandra, R., Menon, R., Dagum, L., Kohr, D., Maydan, D., McDonald, J., (2000) Parallel Programming in OpenMP, , Morgan Kaufmann; Christiansen, M., Decomposition of a combined inventory routing and time constrained ship routing problem (1999) Transportation Science, 33, pp. 3-16; Cordeau, J.F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54 (3), pp. 573-586; Cullen, F., Jarvis, J., Ratliff, D., Set partitioning based heuristics for interactive routing (1981) Networks, 11, pp. 125-144; Desaulniers, G., Desrosiers, J., Erdmann, A., Solomon, M.M., Soumis, F., The VRP with pickup and delivery (2002) The Vehicle Routing Problem, SIAM Monographs on Discrete Mathematics and Applications, Chapter 9, pp. 225-242. , SIAM, Philadelphia, P.

It is assumed that initial contacts are costly and that the number of initial contacts must be minimized simultaneously with maximizing the total number of network members contacted. A bi-objective probabilistic integer programming model is developed that assumes that actors are heterogeneous in the probability that they will pass messages along their ego networks.

Each stack is rear-loaded and is operated in a last-in-first-out (LIFO) fashion, meaning that when an item is picked up, it is positioned at the rear of a stack. An item can only be delivered if it is in that position. This problem arises in the transportation of heavy or dangerous material where unnecessary handling should be avoided, such as in the transportation of cars between car dealers and the transportation of livestock from farms to slaughterhouses. To solve this problem, we propose two different branch-price-and-cut algorithms. The first solves the shortest path pricing problem with the multi-stack policy, while the second incorporates this policy partly in the shortest path pricing problem and generates additional inequalities to the master problem when infeasible multi-stack routes are encountered. Computational results obtained on instances derived from benchmark instances for the pickup and delivery traveling salesman problem with multiple stacks are reported, and reveal the advantage of incorporating the multi-stack policy in the pricing problem.

Each request consists of (i) a pickup location (origin), (ii) a delivery location (destination), and (iii) a maximum allowable travel time from the origin to the destination (maximum ride-time). The problem is to design a tour for the vehicle that (i) starts and ends at the depot, (ii) services all requests, (iii) ensures that each request's ride-time does not exceed its maximum ride-time, and (iv) minimizes the total travel time required by the vehicle to service all requests (objective function). A capacity constraint that may be present is that the weight or volume of the undelivered requests on the vehicle must always be no greater than the vehicle's capacity. In this article, we concurrently analyze the TSPPD-RT with capacity constraints and without capacity constraints. We describe two mathematical formulations of the problem. These formulations are used to derive new lower bounds on the solution to the problem. Then, we provide two exact methods for finding the optimal route that minimizes the total travel cost. Our extensive computational analysis on both versions of the TSPPD-RT shows that the proposed algorithms are capable of solving to optimality instances involving up to 50 requests. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","branch-and-price; cut-and-column generation; dual ascent","Integer programming; Linear programming; Pickups; Travel time; Vehicles; Branch and price; Capacity constraints; Computational analysis; Cut and column; dual ascent; Mathematical formulation; Objective functions; Vehicle's capacity; Traveling salesman problem",,,,,"Applegate, D.L., Bixby, R.E., Chvátal, V., Cook, W.J., (2007) The Traveling Salesman Problem: A Computational Study, Pinceton Series in Applied Mathematics, , Pinceton University Press, NJ, USA; Bartolini, E., Bodin, L.D., Mingozzi, A., (2015) The Traveling Salesman Problem with Pickup, Delivery and Ride-time Constraints: Detailed Computational Results, , http://sal.aalto.fi/en/personnel/enrico.bartolini/, Technical report, Department of Mathematics and Systems Analysis, Aalto University School of Science, Finland; Borndörfer, R., Klostermeier, F., Grötschel, M., Küttner, C., (1997) Telebus Berlin: Vehicle Scheduling in a Dial-a-ride System, , Technical Report SC 9723, Konrad-Zuse-Zentrum für Informationstechnik, Berlin; Cordeau, J.-F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Oper Res, 54, pp. 573-586; Desrosiers, J., Dumas, Y., Soumis, F., A dynamic programming solution of the large-scale single vehicle dial-a-ride problem with time windows (1986) Am J Math Manage Sci, 6, pp. 301-325; Dumitrescu, I., Røpke, S., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The traveling salesman problem with pickup and delivery (2010) Math Program ser A, 121, pp. 269-305; IBM ILOG, (2009) IBM ILOG CPLEX V12.1 User's Manual for CPLEX, , IBM Corporation; Madsen, O.B.G., Ravn, H.F., Rygaard, J.M., A heuristic algorithm for the a dial-a-ride problem with time windows, multiple capacities, and multiple objectives (1995) Ann Oper Res, 60, pp. 193-208; Niskanen, S., Östergård, P.R.J., (2003) Cliquer User's Guide, Version 1.0, , Technical Report, Communications Laboratory, Helsinki University of Technology, Espoo, Finland; Psaraftis, H.N., A dynamic programming solution to the single vehicle many-to-many immediate request dial-a-ride problem (1980) Transp Sci, 14, pp. 130-154; Psaraftis, H.N., An exact algorithm for the single vehicle many-to-many dial-a-ride problem with time windows (1983) Transp Sci, 17, pp. 351-357; Renaud, J., Boctor, F.F., Laporte, G., Pertubation heuristics for the pickup and delivery traveling salesman problem (2002) Comput Oper Res, 29, pp. 1129-1141; Røpke, S., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Models and branch-and-cut algorithms for pickup and delivery problems with time windows (2007) Networks, 49, pp. 258-272; Røpke, S., Pisinger, D., An adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2006) Transp Sci, 40, pp. 455-472; Ruland, K.S., Rodin, E.Y., The pickup and delivery problem: Faces and branch-and-cut algorithm (1997) Comp Math Appl ser A, 33, pp. 1-13; Sexton, T., Bodin, L.D., Optimizing single vehicle many-to-many operations with desired delivery times: I.

Compared with the classical vehicle routing problems (VRPs), the defining characteristic of the MRPSC is that multiple workers are required to work together and start at the same time to carry out a job, that is, the routes of the scheduling subjects are dependent. The incorporation of the synchronization constraints increases the difficulty of the MRPSC significantly and makes the existing VRP exact algorithm inapplicable. Although there are many types of valid inequalities for the VRP or its variants, so far we can only adapt the infeasible path elimination inequality and the weak clique inequality to handle the synchronization constraints in our BPC algorithm. The experimental results at the root node of the branch-and-bound tree show that the employed inequalities can effectively improve the lower bound of the problem. Compared with ILOG CPLEX, our BPC algorithm managed to find optimal solutions for more test instances within 1 hour. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","branch-and-price-and-cut; manpower scheduling; routing; synchronization","Branch and bound method; Costs; Integer programming; Scheduling; Synchronization; Branch-and-price-and-cut; Manpower scheduling; Optimal solutions; Routing; Routing problems; Synchronization constraints; Valid inequality; Vehicle Routing Problems; Algorithms",,,,,"Ascheuer, N., Fischetti, M., Grötschel, M., Solving the asymmetric travelling salesman problem with time windows by branch-and-cut (2001) Math Program, 90, pp. 475-506; Baldacci, R., Christofides, N., Mingozzi, A., An exact algorithm for the vehicle routing problem based on the set partitioning formulation with additional cuts (2008) Math Program, 115, pp. 351-385; Barnhart, C., Johnson, E.L., Nemhauser, G.L., Savelsbergh, M.W.P., Vance, P.H., Branch-and-price: Column generation for solving huge integer programs (1998) Oper Res, 46, pp. 316-329; Cai, Y., Zhang, Z., Guo, S., Qin, H., Lim, A., A tree-based tabu search algorithm for the manpower allocation problem with time windows and job-teaming constraints (2013) Proceedings of the Twenty-Third International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pp. 496-502. , Beijing, China, August 3-9; Cappanera, P., Gouveia, L., Scutellà, M.G., The skill vehicle routing problem (2011) Network Optimization, 6701, pp. 354-364. , in: J.

Applications of the PDPLC arise in healthcare transportation where the objective function is customer-centric or service-based. In the branch-and-price algorithm, we devise an ad hoc label-setting algorithm to solve the pricing problem and employ the bounded bidirectional search strategy to accelerate the label-setting algorithm. The proposed algorithms were tested on a set of instances generated by a common data generator in the literature. The computational results showed that the branch-and-price algorithm outperformed the branch-and-cut algorithm by a large margin, and can solve instances with 40 requests to optimality in a reasonable time frame. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Branch-and-cut;

In this paper, ride time and customer waiting time are modeled through both constraints and an associated penalty in the objective function. We develop a column generation approach, dynamically generating feasible vehicle routes. Handling ride time constraints explicitly in the pricing problem solver requires specific developments. Our dynamic programming approach for pricing problem makes use of a heuristic dominance rule and a heuristic enumeration procedure, which in turns implies that our overall branch- And-price procedure is a heuristic. However, in practice our heuristic solutions are experimentally very close to exact solutions and our approach is numerically competitive in terms of computation times.","Column generation; Dynamic programming; Static dial- A-ride problem","Costs; Information systems; Integer programming; Linear programming; Supply chains; Branch and price; Column generation; Column generation approach; Dial-a-ride problem; Heuristic solutions; Objective functions; Pickup and delivery problem with time windows; Pricing problems; Dynamic programming",,,,,"Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The dial- A-ride problem: Models and algorithms (2007) Annals of Operations Research, 153, pp. 29-46; Cordeau, J.-F., A branch- And-cut algorithm for the dial- A-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54, pp. 573-586; Ropke, S., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Models and branch- And-cut algorithms for pickup and delivery problems with time windows (2007) Networks, 49, pp. 258-272; Parragh, S.N., Introducing heterogeneous users and vehicles into models and algorithms for the dial- A-ride problem (2011) Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 19, pp. 912-930; Parragh, S., Cordeau, J.-F., Doerner, K., Hartl, R., Models and algorithms for the heterogeneous dial- A-ride problem with driver-related constraints (2012) Or Spectrum, 34, pp. 593-633; Contardo, C., Gendron, B., Cordeau, J.-F., A branch- And- cut- And-price algorithm for the capacitated location-routing problem (2011) CIRRELT; http://preshing.com/20120208/a-look-back-At-single-Threaded-cpu-performance",,,"","International Conference on Information Systems, Logistics and Supply Chain","6th International Conference on Information Systems, Logistics and Supply Chain, ILS 2016","1 June 2016 through 4 June 2016",,123124,,,,,"English","ILS - Int.

Car-pooling is the sharing of car journeys so that more than one person travels in a car. Appearing in 1940s as a result of oil shortage, car-pooling, becomes more and more popular, especially in the last decade thanks to massive use of internet. The number of web sites proposing car pooling increases constantly but they merely offer a meeting platform for different actors. The aim of this work is to propose an optimization scheme which can be deployed in such sites.

When the items to be transported are people, it is necessary to simultaneously consider a minimization of operating costs (perspective of transportation systems managers) and a reduction of the inconveniences for the user. An unexpected failure of the planned scheduling in the transport system (e.g. a failure in the engine of a train), may cause a service disruption to a large number of passengers who would remain isolated at origin stations. The result of that situation would be a scattered distributed population in points, with heterogeneous demand in terms of destinations and specific requirements of service. In this paper a model of transportation on-demand is formulated to address an incidence which happens in a transit line (metro, trains), forcing to reschedule the service in such transit line. The goal is to minimize the total cost associated to the delay experienced by users who have to be served by an auxiliary fleet to attend this incidence.","Disruptions; Railways; Rescheduling","Information systems; Operating costs; Supply chains; Transportation; Disruptions; Heterogeneous demand; Pickup and delivery; Railways; Rescheduling; Service disruptions; Transportation system; Unexpected Failures; Railroads",,,,,"Pozo, M.A., Arriola, R., Ortega, F.A., Aplicación de los problemas pickup and delivery en la gestión de emergencias de un sistema de ferrocarril (2009) Actas de Las II Jornadas Sobre Modelos de Optimización Aplicados a la Planificación Robusta Y la Gestión de Los Servicios de Transporte en Caso de Emergencia, pp. 55-64. , MORE, Sevilla, España.

The problem is considered NP-hard, and has typically been solved using metaheuristic methods. An agent-based simulation (ABS) model was developed, where each vehicle bids to service customers based on a weighted objective function that considers the cost to service the customer and the time quality of the service that would be achieved. The approach applied a pre-processing technique to reduce the search space, given the service time window constraints. Tests of the model showed significantly better customer transit and waiting times than the benchmark datasets. The ABS was able to obtain solutions for much larger problem sizes than the benchmark solutions, with this work being the first known application of ABS to the DARP. ï¿½ 2016, South African Institute of Industrial Engineering.

The most focuses of this trend is intelligent transportation. As a supplementary transportation tools between private transportation and public transportation, taxis have been the useful complement of the city public transportation system. The low-carbon and energy-saving way for taxis is called taxi-pooling. In this work, we focus on the routing problem of taxi-pooling. Specifically, with the analysis of the taxi-pooling problem, we investigate the characteristics and restraints, and construct an optimization model which aims to minimize the cost of passengers, maximize the benefit of drivers and maximize the load rate. To solve the above model, we propose to employ a modified Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) model. Our simulation results show that our method can effectively solve the taxi-pooling routing problem with the above three objectives.","Ant Colony Optimization (ACO); Energy-saving; Routing; Taxi-pooling","Artificial intelligence;

Users formulate requests specifying desired locations and times of pickup and delivery. Given a set of requests, the vehicle routes are to be planned and scheduled in order to minimize both the number of vehicles used and the journey durations, while respecting a set of constraints imposed by the service, the passengers and the vehicles. In a dynamic environment, requests arrive gradually along the day, and the routes must be adjusted in real time to accommodate the new demand. In this work we propose an approach that simulates a dynamic service using mixed linear programming models to produce good solutions.

In this paper, delivery tasks for required jobs are preemptive allowed at most once before the jobs arrive at exit. The preemptive jobs are temporarily stored in a buffer stack, in which jobs pickup and delivery should be performed under the Last-In-First-Out policy. This feature makes our problem more changeling and interesting. In this paper, FCSP is first formulated as an integer programming model. Based on properties of the problem, FCSP is then reformulated with a much tighter bound. After that, several families of valid inequalities are proposed and used within a Branch-and-Cut framework. In addition, preprocessing techniques and separation heuristics are used to improve algorithm efficiency. Computational experiments are carried out on practical data collected from the steel company. The results support both effectiveness and efficiency of the model refinements as well as the Branch-and-Cut algorithm proposed. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Branch-and-Cut; Factory crane scheduling problem; Integer linear programming model; Valid inequalities","Algorithms; Computational efficiency; Cranes; Job shop scheduling; Scheduling; Branch and cut; Branch-and-cut algorithms; Crane scheduling; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Integer linear programming models; Integer programming models; Preprocessing techniques; Valid inequality; Integer programming",,,,,"Aron, I.D., Genç-Kaya, L., Harjunkoski, I., Hoda, S., Hooker, J.N., Factory Crane Scheduling by Dynamic Programming.

However, if not carefully designed, taxi-sharing may cause more harm than benefit - it becomes harder to strike the balance between driver's profit and passenger's quality of service (e.g. travel time, number of strangers that share a taxi, etc.). In this paper, we propose a QoS-aware taxi-sharing system design - QA-Share - by addressing two important challenges. First, QA-Share aims to maximize driver profit and user experience at the same time. Second, QA-Share continuously optimizes these two metrics by dynamically adapting its schedule as new requests arrive, without entering an oscillation state. To address these two challenges, we have formulated the optimization problem using integer linear programming, and derived the optimal solution under a small system scale. When the number of requests and taxis becomes large, we have devised a heuristic algorithm that has a much faster execution time. We have also studied how to minimize oscillations caused by schedule re-calculations by dynamically tuning the update threshold. We have evaluated our approach with real-world dataset in a Chinese city - ZhenJiang - which contains the GPS traces recorded by over 3,000 taxis during a period of three months in 2013. Our results show that the QoS and profit is increased by 38% compared to earlier schemes. © 2015 IEEE.","Cities and towns; Delays; Dispatching; Public transportation; Quality of service; Schedules; Servers","Heuristic algorithms; Integer programming; Optimization; Profitability; Scheduling; Servers; Taxicabs; Transportation; Travel time; Cities and towns; Delays; Dispatching; Integer Linear Programming; Optimal solutions; Optimization problems; Oscillation state; Public transportation; Quality of service",,,,,"Taxi, N., Commission, L., (2011) Taxi of Tomorrow Survey; Daily, S., (2014) Taxi Shift Change A Headache for Locals, , http//www.china.org.cn/english/travel/158628.htm, [Online; accessed 13-Dec-2014]; Tao, C.-C., Chen, C.-Y., Heuristic algorithms for the dynamic taxipooling problem based on intelligent transportation system technologies (2007) Proceedings of IEEE FSKD; Chen, P.-Y., Liu, J.-W., Chen, W.-T., A fuel-saving and pollution-reducing dynamic taxi-sharing protocol in vanets (2010) Proceedings of IEEE VTC; Zhang, D., Li, Y., Zhang, F., Lu, M., Liu, Y., He, T., Coride: Carpool service with a win-win fare model for large-scale taxicab networks (2013) Proceedings of ACM SenSys; Ma, S., Zheng, Y., Wolfson, O., T-share: A largescale dynamic taxi ridesharing service (2013) Proceedings of IEEE ICDE; Wang, Y., Zheng, Y., Xue, Y., Travel time estimation of a path using sparse trajectories (2014) Proceedings of ACM SIGKDD; (2012) Beijing Promotes Taxi Sharing to Ease Traffic Jams, , http/www.nihao-salam.com/news-detail.php?id=MTUxMQ, CNTV-English,[Online; accessed 30-July-2014]; Liu, X., Biagioni, J., Eriksson, J., Wang, Y., Forman, G., Zhu, Y., Mining large-scale, sparse GPS traces for map inference: Comparison of approaches (2012) Proceedings of ACM SIGKDD; Zheng, J., Ni, L.M., Time-dependent trajectory regression on road networks via multi-task learning (2013) Proceedings of AAAI; Idé, T., Sugiyama, M., Trajectory regression on road networks (2011) Proceedings of AAAI; He, Z., Cao, J., Li, T., Mice: A real-time traffic estimation based vehicular path planning solution using vanets (2012) Proceedings of IEEE ICCVE; Cordeau, J.-F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the diala-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54 (3), pp. 573-586; Hopcroft, J.E., Karp, R.M., An n5/2 algorithm for maximum matchings in bipartite graphs (1973) SIAM Journal on Computing, 2 (4), pp. 225-231; Wang, W., Li, B., Liang, B., Dominant resource fairness in cloud computing systems with heterogeneous servers (2014) Proceedings of IEEE INFOCOM; Blanton, E., Fahmy, S., Banerjee, S., Resource management in an active measurement service (2008) Proceedings of the IEEE GIS; Lee, S.C., Jiang, J.W., Lui, J.C., Chiu, D.-M., Interplay of isps: Distributed resource allocation and revenue maximization (2006) Proceedings of IEEE ICDCS; Healy, P., Moll, R., A new extension of local search applied to the dial-a-ride problem (1995) European Journal of Operational Research, 83 (1), pp. 83-104; Aldaihani, M., Dessouky, M.M., Hybrid scheduling methods for paratransit operations (2003) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 45 (1), pp. 75-96; Lin, Y., Li, W., Qiu, F., Xu, H., Research on optimization of vehicle routing problem for ride-sharing taxi (2012) Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 43, pp. 494-502; Attanasio, A., Cordeau, J.-F., Ghiani, G., Laporte, G., Parallel tabu search heuristics for the dynamic multivehicle dial-a-ride problem (2004) Parallel Computing, 30 (3), pp. 377-387; Yuan, J., Zheng, Y., Zhang, L., Xie, X., Sun, G., Where to find my next passenger (2011) Proceedings of ACM UbiComp, pp. 109-118; Zheng, X., Liang, X., Xu, K., Where to wait for a taxi (2012) Proceedings of ACM SIGKDD; Lu, J.-L., Yeh, M.-Y., Hsu, Y.-C., Yang, S.-N., Gan, C.-H., Chen, M.-S., Operating electric taxi fleets: A new dispatching strategy with charging plans (2012) Proceedings of IEEE IEVC",,,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","12th Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking, SECON 2015","22 June 2015 through 25 June 2015",,118375,,9781467373319,,,"English","Annu.

The LIFO loading rule ensures that no handling is required prior to unloading an item from a vehicle: a linear stack loading structure is maintained and an item can only be delivered if it is the last one in the stack. Three exact branch-price-and-cut algorithms are proposed for this problem. The first incorporates the LIFO constraints in the master problem. The second one handles the LIFO constraints directly in the shortest path pricing problem. It applies a dynamic programming algorithm relying on an ad hoc dominance criterion. The third algorithm is a hybrid between the first two methods. Known valid inequalities are adapted to the PDPTWL and the impact of different path relaxations on the total computation time is investigated. Computational results obtained on instances derived from known instances of the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (PDPTW) are reported. © 2015 INFORMS.","Branch-price-and-cut; Column generation; Last-in-first-out loading; Valid inequalities; Vehicle routing with pickup and delivery","Algorithms; Costs; Crashworthiness; Dynamic programming; Linear programming; Pickups; Unloading; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Branch-price-and-cut; Column generation; Last in first outs; Pickup and delivery; Valid inequality; Loading",,,,,"Baldacci, R., Bartolini, E., Mingozzi, A., An exact algorithm for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2011) Oper.

The vehicle carries a container divided into stacks of fixed height, each following a Last-In-First-Out policy, and the aim is to perform pickups and deliveries by minimizing the total routing cost and ensuring a feasible loading/unloading of the vehicle. A realistic generalization of the DTSPMS arises when a single vehicle is not enough to collect all products, and therefore multiple, and possibly heterogeneous vehicles are needed to perform the transportation operations. This paper introduces and formulates this generalization, that we refer as the Double Vehicle Routing Problem with Multiple Stacks. It proposes three models, the first one based on a three-index formulation and solved by a branch-and-cut algorithm, and the other two based on two set partitioning formulations using different families of columns and solved by a branch-and-price and a branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm, respectively. The performance of these algorithms has been studied on a wide family of benchmark test instances, observing that, although the branch-and-cut algorithm shows a better performance on instances with a small number of vehicles, the performance of the branch-and-price and the branch-and-price-and-cut algorithms improves as the number of vehicles grows. Additionally, the first set partitioning formulation yields tighter lower bounds, but the second formulation, because of its simplicity, provides better convergence properties, solving instances with up to fifty vertices to proven optimality. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the reasons why this problem is so hard to solve is because there are no readily available methods to infer unmet taxi demand from data. An algorithm that reliably does so would be of enormous value to fleet operators because it could be used to dispatch available taxis to areas where passenger demand greatly exceeds supply. In this paper, we formally define unmet taxi demand and develop a heuristic algorithm to quantify it. We explain how our method improves on traditional approaches and present the theoretical details which underpin our algorithm. Finally, we develop a smartphone application that uses our algorithm together with a live taxi data feed to provide real time recommendations to participating drivers and efficiently route taxis to where they are needed most. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Algorithms; Electronic data interchange; Heuristic algorithms; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Taxicabs; Transportation; Data feed; Fleet operators; Passenger demands; Real time; Smart-phone applications; Taxi fleets; Traditional approaches; Fleet operations",,,,,"Post, T.C., (2008) Taxi Drivers Earn Average of NT$21, 305 per Month, , http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2008/08/16/170293/Taxi-drivers.htm, [Online; accessed 13-April-2015]; Anwar, A., Volkov, M., Rus, D., Changinow: A mobile application for efficient taxi allocation at airports (2013) Intelligent Transportation Systems-(ITSC), 2013 16th International IEEE Conference On.

In this paper, we focus on a common destination ridesharing system which is of interest in large organizations such as companies and government offices. Particularly, such organizations are looking at using company owned vehicles to offer a ridesharing service by which employees carpool to work thus leading to several benefits that include decreasing pressure on on-campus parking spaces, lowering localized on-campus congestion, in addition to offering a greener transportation mode while lowering transportation costs for employees. Based on discussions with our industry partners, optimizing the distribution of limited number of company vehicles while insuring robustness against unlikely vehicle unavailability is of critical importance. Thus in this paper, we present a stochastic mixed integer programming model to optimize the allocation of shared vehicles to employees while taking into account the unforeseen event of vehicle unavailability which would require some participants to take own vehicles or rerouting of existing vehicles. Since solving the proposed model to optimality is computationally challenging for problems of large sizes, we also propose a heuristic that is capable of finding good quality solutions in limited computational time. The proposed model and heuristic are tested on several instances of varying sizes showing the computational performance. Finally, a test case based on the city of Rome, Italy is presented and insights related to vehicle distribution and travel time savings are discussed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Car placement; Integer programming; Ridesharing","Amphibious vehicles; Optimization; Stochastic models; Traffic congestion; Transportation; Travel time; Vehicles; Car placement; Computational performance; Public transportation; Ride-sharing; Stochastic mixed integer programming; Stochastic optimization approach; Transportation cost; Travel time savings; Integer programming; car ownership; linear programing; numerical model; public transport; stochasticity; transportation planning; travel demand; travel time; Italy; Lazio; Roma [Lazio]; Rome",,,,,"Achterberg, T., Berthold, T., Improving the feasibility pump (2007) Discrete Optimization, 4 (1), pp. 77-86; Agatz, N., Erera, A., Savelsbergh, M., Wang, X., Dynamic ride-sharing: a simulation study in metro Atlanta (2011) Transportation Research Part B, 45, pp. 1450-1464; Agatz, N., Erera, A., Savelsbergh, M., Wang, X., Optimization for dynamic ride-sharing: a review (2012) European Journal of Operational Research, 223 (2), pp. 295-303; Attanasio, A., Cordeau, J.-F., Ghiani, G., Laporte, G., Parallel tabu search heuristics for the dynamic multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2004) Parallel Computing, 30 (3), pp. 377-387; Baldacci, R., Maniezzo, V., Mingozzi, A., An exact method for the car pooling problem based on Lagrangean column generation (2004) Operations Research, 52 (3), pp. 422-439; Clarke, G., Wright, J., Scheduling of vehicles from a central depot to a number of delivery points (1964) Operations Research, 12 (4), pp. 568-581; Cordeau, J.-F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54 (3), pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B, 37 (6), pp. 579-594; Desaulniers, G., Desrosiers, J., Erdmann, A., Solomon, M.M., Soumis, F., VRP with pickup and delivery (2001) The Vehicle Routing Problem, pp. 225-242. , SIAM, Philadelphia, PA, P.

Vehicle relocation, however, can lead to an imbalance of staff members between stations. Thus, staff members, themselves, need to be relocated between stations to perform the vehicle relocations. This study addresses the joint optimization of vehicle relocation and staff rebalancing using two integrated multi-traveling salesman formulations. Results show that fleet size is more sensitive to demand than staff size, staff size is inversely related to vehicle cost, and that vehicle relocation time increases with vehicle cost. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Carsharing; Decision support system; Optimization; Rebalance; Relocation","decision support system; optimization; transport vehicle; transportation system",,,,,"Alfian, G., Rhee, J., Yoon, B., A simulation tool for prioritizing product-service system (PPS) models in a carsharing service (2014) Comput.

The monetary constraints provide incentives for both passengers and taxi drivers: passengers will not pay more compared with no ridesharing and get compensated if their travel time is lengthened due to ridesharing; taxi drivers will make money for all the detour distance due to ridesharing. While such a system is of significant social and environmental benefit, e.g., saving energy consumption and satisfying people's commute, real-time taxi-sharing has not been well studied yet. To this end, we devise a mobile-cloud architecture based taxi-sharing system. Taxi riders and taxi drivers use the taxi-sharing service provided by the system via a smart phone App. The Cloud first finds candidate taxis quickly for a taxi ride request using a taxi searching algorithm supported by a spatio-temporal index. A scheduling process is then performed in the cloud to select a taxi that satisfies the request with minimum increase in travel distance. We built an experimental platform using the GPS trajectories generated by over 33,000 taxis over a period of three months. A ride request generator is developed (available at http://cs.uic.edu/∼sma/ridesharing) in terms of the stochastic process modelling real ride requests learned from the data set. Tested on this platform with extensive experiments, our proposed system demonstrated its efficiency, effectiveness and scalability. For example, when the ratio of the number of ride requests to the number of taxis is 6, our proposed system serves three times as many taxi riders as that when no ridesharing is performed while saving 11 percent in total travel distance and 7 percent taxi fare per rider. © 1989-2012 IEEE.","GPS trajectory; intelliegent transportation systems; ridesharing; Spatial databases and GIS; taxi-sharing; urban computing","Behavioral research; Energy utilization; Mobile cloud computing; Random processes; Smartphones; Stochastic systems; Transportation; Travel time; Urban transportation; Gps trajectories; Ride-sharing; Spatial databases and GIS; taxi-sharing; Transportation system; Urban computing; Taxicabs",,,,,"Baldacci, R., Maniezzo, V., Mingozzi, A., An exact method for the car pooling problem based on lagrangean column generation (2004) Oper.

We model the problem as a multi-trip dial-a-ride problem (MTDARP), which requires designing several routes for each ambulance. A route is a sequence of locations, starting and terminating at the depot (hospital), according to which the ambulance picks up clients at the origins and delivers them to the destinations. A route is feasible only if it satisfies a series of side constraints, such as the pair and precedence constraints, capacity limit, ride time, route duration limit and time windows. Owing to the route duration limit, in particular, every ambulance is scheduled to operate several routes during the working period. To prevent the spread of disease, the interior of the ambulances needs to be disinfected at the depot between two consecutive trips. The primary aim of the problem investigated herein is to service more requests with the given resources, and to minimize the total travel cost for the same number of requests. In this paper, we provide a mathematical formulation for the problem and develop a memetic algorithm with a customized recombination operator. Moreover, the segment-based evaluation method is adapted to examine the moves quickly. The performance of the proposed algorithm is assessed using the real-world data from 2009 and compared with results obtained by solving the mathematical model. In addition, the proposed algorithm is adapted to solve the classic DARP instances, and found to perform well on medium-scale instances.

The fleet is assumed to be heterogeneous with a novel feature that allows the vehicles to be configured before service begins to handle various types of demand. The work was motivated by a daily route planning problem arising at a senior activity center. A fleet of configurable vans is available each day to transport participants to and from the center, as well as to secondary facilities for rehabilitative and medical treatment. The number of participants and support equipment that a van can accommodate depends on how it is configured. An exact method is introduced based on branch and price and cut. At each node in the search tree, the master problem is solved by column generation to find a lower bound. To improve the bound, subset-row inequalities are applied to the variables of the master problem. Columns are generated by solving the pricing subproblems with a labeling algorithm enhanced by new dominance conditions. Local search on the current set of columns is used to quickly find promising additions. Implementation details and ways to improve the performance of the overall procedure are discussed. Testing was done on a set of real instances as well as a set of randomly generated instances with up to 50 customer requests. The results show that optimal solutions are obtained in the majority of cases. © 2015 INFORMS.","Branch and price and cut; Configurable vehicle capacity; Dial-a-ride problem; Heterogeneous vehicles; Pickup and delivery problem","Algorithms; Cabs (truck); Costs; Fleet operations; Linear programming; Pickups; Trucks; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Branch-and-price-and-cut; Dial-a-ride problem; Heterogeneous vehicles; Pickup and delivery problems; Vehicle capacity; Integer programming",,,,,"Alexandrescu, A., (2001) Modern CCC Design: Generic Programming and Design Patterns Applied, , Addison-Wesley, Boston; Baldacci, R., Bartolini, E., Mingozzi, A., An exact algorithm for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2011) Oper.

The most prevalent context of dynamic time windows is when precedence is given for the two operations so that it is a priori specified that one operation must take place before the other. A prominent vehicle routing problem with dynamic time windows and precedence is the dial-a-ride problem (DARP), where user-specified transportation requests from origin to destination points must be serviced. The paper presents a new branch-and-cut-and-price solution approach for the DARP, the prototypical vehicle-routing problem with ordinary and dynamic time windows. For the first time (to our knowledge), both ordinary and dynamic time windows are handled in the column-generation subproblem. For the solution, an effective column-generation pricing procedure is derived that allows fast shortest-path computations due to new dominance rules. The new approach is compared with alternative column-generation algorithms that handle dynamic time windows either as constraints of the master program or with less effective labeling procedures. Computational experiments indicate the superiority of the new approach. © 2015 INFORMS.","Branch-and-price; Dial-a-ride problem; Dynamic time windows; Labeling algorithm; Ride-time constraints; Time synchronization; Transportation; Vehicle routing","Costs; Integer programming; Linear programming; Network routing; Routing algorithms; Transportation; Vehicles; Branch and price; Dial-a-ride problem; Dynamic time; Labeling algorithms; Time constraints; Time synchronization; Vehicle routing",,,,,"Ascheuer, N., Fischetti, M., Grötschel, M., A polyhedral study of the asymmetric traveling salesman problem with time windows (2000) Networks, 36 (2), pp. 69-79; Azi, N., Gendreau, M., Potvin, J.-Y., An exact algorithm for a vehicle routing problem with time windows and multiple use of vehicles (2010) Eur.

Users place transportation requests, specifying a pickup location, a delivery location, and a time window for either of the two. Based on maximum user ride time considerations, the second time window is generated. A given fleet of vehicles, each with a certain capacity, is available to serve these requests, and maximum route duration constraints have to be respected. Each request is associated with a revenue and the objective is to maximize the total profit, that is, the total revenue minus the total costs. Transportation requests involving several persons may be split if it is beneficial to do so. We formulate the DARPSRP as a mixed-integer program using position variables and in terms of a path-based formulation. For the solution of the latter, we design a branch-and-price algorithm. The largest instance solved to optimality, when applied to available instances from the literature, has 40 requests; when applied to newly generated instances, the largest instance solved to optimality consists of 24 requests. To solve larger instances a variable neighborhood search algorithm is developed. We investigate the impact of request splitting under different geographical settings, assuming favorable settings for request splitting in terms of the number of people per request. The largest benefits from request splitting are obtained for problem settings exhibiting clustered customer locations. © 2015 INFORMS.","Branch-and-price; Pickup and delivery; Split requests; Variable neighborhood search","Costs; Crashworthiness; Fleet operations; Optimization; Pickups; Profitability; Vehicle routing; Branch and price; Branch-and-price algorithms; Dial-a-ride problem; Mixed-integer programs; Pickup and delivery; Position variables; Split requests; Variable neighborhood search; Integer programming",,,,,"Almada-Lobo, B., Oliveira, J.F., Carravilla, M.A., Production planning and scheduling in the glass container industry: A VNS approach (2008) Internat.

Such transportation problem has to respect the limits of the maximum route length, the maximum user ride time and the required time windows. It can be modeled as a static dial-a-ride problem (DARP) that is known to be NP-hard. For this problem, a hybrid algorithm combining Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Reduced Variable Neighborhood Search (RVNS) is developed to obtain its near-optimal solution, in which the RVNS is used to improve the quality of the solutions generated by the GA. Moreover, a simple constructive method is proposed to obtain high-quality initial population and a new crossover operator for the GA is adapted to the problem. Computational results on benchmark instances with up to 13 vehicles and 144 requests show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the recently proposed hybrid Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) algorithm.","Dial-a-ride problem (DARP); Genetic algorithm; Handicapped person transportation; Hybrid algorithm; Reduced Variable Neighborhood Search","Algorithms; Benchmarking; Disabled persons; Fleet operations; Optimization; Transportation; Transportation routes; Computational results; Constructive methods; Dial-a-ride problem; Hybrid algorithms; Large neighborhood search; Near-optimal solutions; Transportation problem; Variable neighborhood search; Genetic algorithms",,,,,"Borndörfer, R., Klostermeier, F., Grötschel, M., Küttner, C., (1997) Telebus Berlin: Vehicle Scheduling in a Dial-a-ride System, , Technical, Konrad-Zuse-Zentrum fur Informationstechnik, Berlin; Chevrier, R., Liefooghe, A., Jourdan, L., Dhaenens, C., Solving a dial-a-ride problem with a hybrid evolutionary multi-objective approach: Application to demand responsive transport (2012) Applied Soft Computing Journal, 12 (4), pp. 1247-1258; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-aride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 37 (6), pp. 579-594; Cordeau, J.-F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54 (3), pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem: Models and algorithms (2007) Annals of Operations Research, 153 (1), pp. 29-46; Guerriero, F., Bruni, M.E., Greco, F., A hybrid greedy randomized adaptive search heuristic to solve the dial-a-ride problem (2013) Asia-pacific Journal of Operational Research, 30 (1); Holland, J.H., (1975) Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems, , University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor, MI; Jorgensen, R.M., Larsen, J., Bergvinsdottir, K.B., Solving the dial-a-ride problem using genetic algorithms (2007) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 58 (10), pp. 1321-1331; Karabuk, S., A nested decomposition approach for solving the paratransit vehicle scheduling problem (2009) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 43 (4), pp. 448-465; Kirchler, D., Wolfler Calvo, R., A granular tabu search algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2013) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 56, pp. 120-135; Muelas, S., Latorre, A., Peña, J.-M., A variable neighborhood search algorithm for the optimization of a dial-a-ride problem in a large city (2013) Expert Systems with Applications, 40 (14), pp. 5516-5531. , a, a b; Parragh, S.N., Doerner, K.F., Hartl, R.F., Variable neighborhood search for the dial-a-ride problem (2010) Computers & Operations Research, 37, pp. 1129-1138; Parragh, S.N., Introducing heterogeneous users and vehicles into models and algorithms for the dial-a-ride problem (2011) Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 19 (5), pp. 912-930; Parragh, S.N., Schmid, V., Hybrid column generation and large neighborhood search for the dial-a-ride problem (2013) Computers and Operations Research, 40 (1), pp. 490-497; Toth, P., Vigo, D., Fast local search algorithms for the handicapped persons transportation problem (1996) Meta-heuristics: Theory and Applications, pp. 677-690. , Osman IH, Kelly JP eds, Kluwer, Boston; Toth, P., Vigo, D., Heuristic algorithms for the handicapped persons transportation problem (1997) Transportation Science, 31, pp. 60-71; Van Lon, R.R.S., Holvoet, T., Vanden Berghe, G., Wenseleers, T., Branke, J., (2012) Evolutionary Synthesis of Multi-agent Systems for Dynamic Dial-a-ride Problems GECCO'12-proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Companion, pp. 331-336; Wang, H.-F., Chen, Y.-Y., A genetic algorithm for the simultaneous delivery and pickup problems with time window (2012) Computers and Industrial Engineering, 62, pp. 84-95",,"Kacem I.","","Universite de Lorraine","45th International Conference on Computers and Industrial Engineering, CIE 2015","28 October 2015 through 30 October 2015",,118692,,,,,"English","Proc. - CIE: Int.

Its main objective is to minimize the number of delivering trucks, whereas the secondary objective is to decrease the distance traveled during the service. A feasible routing schedule must satisfy the time window, capacity and precedence constraints. In this paper, we propose to partition the search space in our parallel guided ejection search algorithm (P-GES) to minimize the fleet size in the PDPTW. The introduced techniques help decrease the convergence time of the algorithm without affecting the quality of results. An extensive experimental study (comprising nearly 52,000 CPU hours on an SMP cluster) performed on the Li and Lim's benchmark set shows that the parallel algorithm is effective, and is able to retrieve very high-quality results.

In addition, travel demand is low and residents may have different destinations. Furthermore, rural communities vary widely within regions. Therefore, it is inadvisable to run a fixed schedule transit service. Government and local authorities have attempted to maintain public transit services in rural areas and improve accessibility to these services. Dial-a-Ride (DAR) systems are a form of flexible transportation for better service in rural areas by covering a relatively large area with respect to potential demand. The complexity of the problem makes the DAR problem an NP-hard problem, whose optimal solution is difficult to find in cases of medium- and large-sized problems. As a result, most paper handling solution methods for a DAR problem are based on heuristic methods. Here, we provide a solution for the DAR service problem based on a mixed-integer formulation. This study mainly discusses enhancing transit service in rural areas with complex road network topographies where fixed services are less available or are cost ineffective. In addition, we discuss improving service quality with respect to different user types. More attention is paid to considering the social side cost by minimizing not only operating costs but also the total travel times of all travelers. Computational experiments based on real-life data from a locality in Gifu Prefecture, Japan were carried out to test the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The results show decreased mean waiting time and excess ride time by considering user costs. © 2015 The Authors.","Dial-A-Ride; Rural Areas; Social Costs",,,,,,"Attanasio, A., Cordeau, J.F., Ghiani, G., Laporte, G., Parallel tabu search heuristics for the dynamic multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2004) Parallel Computing, 30 (3), pp. 377-387; (2014) Regional Standard Cost Used for Application of Subsidy for Assuring, Maintaining and Improving Regional Public Transport System, , Chubu District Transport Bureau, Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (In Japanese); Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem (DARP): Variants, modeling issues and algorithms (2003) 4OR: A Quarterly Journal of Operations Research, 1, pp. 89-101; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 37 (6), pp. 579-594; Cordeau, J.F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54 (3), pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem: Models and algorithms (2007) Annals of Operations Research, 153, pp. 29-46; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., Potvin, J.Y., Savelsbergh, M.W., (2007) Transportation on Demand.

The task is to find a set of minimum-cost routes satisfying pairing and precedence, capacities, and time windows. Additionally, temporal synchronization constraints couple the service times at the pickup and delivery locations of the customer requests in the following way: a request has to be delivered within prespecified minimum and maximum time lags (called ride times) after it has been picked up. The presence of these ride-time constraints severely complicates the subproblem of the natural column-generation formulation of the SPDP so that it is not clear if their integration into the subproblem pays off in an integer column-generation approach. Therefore, we develop four branch-and-cut-and-price algorithms for the SPDP based on column-generation formulations that use different subproblems. Two of these subproblems are considered for the first time in this paper have not been studied before. We derive new dominance rules and labeling algorithms for their effective solution. Extensive computational results indicate that integrating either both types of ride-time constraints or only the maximum ride-time constraints into the subproblem results in the strongest overall approach. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Association of European Operational Research Societies (EURO) withinthe International Federation of Operational Research Societies (IFORS).

Although Dial-a-ride Problems (DARP) have been discussed for several decades, most researchers have worked to develop algorithms with low computational cost under the minimal total travel costs, and fewer studies have considered how changes in travel time might affect the vehicle routes and service sequences. Ignoring such variations in travel time when design vehicle routes and schedules might lead to the production of inefficient vehicle routes, as well as incorrect actual vehicle arrival times at the related nodes. The purpose of this paper is to construct a DARP formulation with consideration of time-dependent travel times and utilizes the traffic simulation software, DynaTAIWAN, to simulate the real traffic conditions in order to obtain the time-dependent travel time matrices. The branch-and-price approach is introduced for the time-dependent DARP and tested by examining the sub-network of Kaohsiung City, Taiwan. The numerical results reveal that the length of the time window can significantly affect the vehicle routes and quantitative measurements. As the length of the time window increases, the objective value and the number of vehicles will reduce significantly. However, the CPU time, the average pickup delay time, the average delivery delay time and the average actual ride time (ART)/direct ride time (DRT) will increase significantly as the length of the time window increases. Designing the vehicle routes to reduce operating costs and satisfy the requirements of customers is a difficult task, and a trade-off must be made between these goals.

Regular public road transportation traditionally uses fixed routes and schedules, which can be extremely expensive in rural areas and certain periods of the day in urban areas due to low and unpredictable demand. Demand Responsive Transportation systems are a kind of hybrid transportation approach between a taxi and a bus that try to address these problems with routes and frequencies that may vary according to the actual observed demand. Demand Responsive Transportation seems to have potential to answer the sustainability and social inclusion challenges in a context of austerity. However, DRT projects may fail: it is not only important to solve the underlying model in an efficient way, but also to understand how different ways of operating the service affect customers and operators. To help design DRT services, we developed an innovative approach integrating simulation and optimization. Using this simulator, we compared a real night-time bus service in the city of Porto, Portugal, with a hypothetical flexible DRT service for the same scenario. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","General welfare; Heuristics; Mass transit; Optimization; Simulation modeling; Vehicle Routing",,,,,,"Brake, J., Mulley, C., Nelson, J., (2006) Good practice guide for demand responsive transport services using telematics, , University of Newcastle upon Tyne, School of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Newcastle upon Tyne; Brake, J., Mulley, C., Nelson, J., Wright, S., Key lessons learned from recent experience with flexible transport services (2007) Transport Policy, 14 (6), pp. 458-466; Branke, J., Deb, K., Miettinen, K., Słowiński, R., (2008) Multiobjective optimization: Interactive and evolutionary approaches, , Springer-Verlag; Cervero, R., Transit pricing research (1990) Transportation, 17 (2), pp. 117-139; Chang, M.-S., Chen, S.-R., Hsueh, C.-F., Real-time vehicle routing problem with time windows and simultaneous delivery/pickup demands (2003) Journal of the Eastern Asia Society for Transportation Studies, 5, p. 14; Cordeau, J.F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54 (3), pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem: models and algorithms (2007) Annals of Operations Research, 153 (1), pp. 29-46; Curtin, J., Effects of fares on transit riding (1968) Highway Research Record, 213, pp. 8-18; Dantzig, G., Ramser, J., The truck dispatching problem (1959) Management Science, 6 (1), pp. 80-91; Deflorio, F., Simulation of requests in demand responsive transport systems (2011) IET Intelligent Transport Systems, 5 (3), pp. 159-167; Enoch, M., Potter, S., Parkhurst, G., Smith, M., (2006) Why do demand responsive transport systems fail?, , Paper presented at the Transport Research Board 85th Anual Meeting, Washington DC; (2011) CIVITAS ELAN - GATO, , http://www.civitas-initiative.org/index.php?id=138&news_id=1251, Retrieved 12-2012, 2012; Feo, T., Resende, M., A probabilistic heuristic for a computationally difficult set covering problem (1989) Operations Research Letters, 8 (2), pp. 67-71; Fu, L., A simulation model for evaluating advanced dial-a-ride paratransit systems (2002) Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 36 (4), pp. 291-307; Gomes, R., Sousa, J.P., Galvão, T., A GRASP-based approach for demand responsive transportation (2014) International Journal of Transportation, 2 (1), pp. 21-32; Gomes, R., Sousa, J.P., Galvão, T., An integrated approach for the design of demand responsive transportation services (2014) Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 262, pp. 223-235; Hensher, D., Button, K., (2007) Handbook of transport modelling, , Emerald, Inc; Kindervater, G., Savelsbergh, M., Vehicle routing: handling edge exchanges (1997) Local search in combinatorial optimization, pp. 311-336. , John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, E.

Sharing taxis which has been prominent in several developing countries is also becoming common in several cities around the world. Sharing taxis presents several advantages as it minimizes vacant seats in cars thus reducing costs on taxi operators which results in significantly lower taxi fares for passengers. Besides the economical advantages, taxi sharing is highly important for reducing congestion on the roads and for minimizing the impact of transportation on the environment. In this paper, we formulate the problem of assigning passengers to taxis and computing the optimal routes of taxis as a mixed integer program. To solve the proposed model, we present a Lagrangian decomposition approach which exploits the structure of the problem leading to smaller problems that are solved separately. Furthermore, we propose two heuristics that are used to obtain good quality feasible solutions. The Lagrangian approach along with the heuristics are implemented and compared to solving the full problem using CPLEX. The computational results indicate the efficiency of the methodology in providing tighter bounds than CPLEX in shorter computational time. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Integer programming; Lagrangian relaxation;

Demand Responsive Transport systems (DRT) that provide a share transportation services with flexible routes and focus on optimizing of economic and environmental value are becoming an important part of public transportation. In this paper we propose a new approach to design of DRT models which considers DRT as a multi-agent system (MAS) where various autonomous agents represent interests of system's stakeholders. The distributed nature of the MAS facilitates design of scalable implementations in modern cloud environments. We also propose a planning algorithm based on combinatorial auctions (CA) that allows to express commodity of multiple transportation scenarios by evident means of the bids. Using the mechanism of CA we may fully take into account the presence of complementariness and substitutability among the items that differ across bidders. Further, we describe design principles of our proposed software with a prototype implementation. We believe that our approach to multi-agent modeling is general enough to provide the flexibility necessary for adoption of DRT-services modeling into real-world scenarios. The results of modeling have been compared against several cases of a local bus provider and validated in a set of computational experiments. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

All of these features originate from practical applications in recent years. To formulate the problem, we propose two mathematical models that use different methods to deal with requests associated with the depot. To further strengthen the models, we propose eight families of valid inequalities, and based on them, we propose a branch-and-cut algorithm to solve the problem. The branch-and-cut algorithm was extensively tested on a set of instances generated according to the data of a real world application. The computational results showed that seven families of inequalities can improve the lower bounds substantially and the branch-and-cut algorithm can solve instances with up to 22 requests within 4 h. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Branch-and-cut;

At the same time, the mean occupancy rate of personal vehicle trips in the United States is only 1.6 persons per vehicle mile. Ridesharing has the potential to solve many environmental, congestion, pollution, and energy problems. In this paper, we introduce the problem of large scale real-time ridesharing with service guarantee on road networks. Trip requests are dynamically matched to vehicles while trip waiting and service time constraints are satisfied. We first propose two scheduling algorithms: a branch-and-bound algorithm and an integer programing algorithm. However, these algorithms do not adapt well to the dynamic nature of the ridesharing problem. Thus, we propose kinetic tree algorithms which are better suited to efficient scheduling of dynamic requests and adjust routes on-the-fly. We perform experiments on a large Shanghai taxi dataset. Results show that the kinetic tree algorithms outperform other algorithms significantly. © 2014 VLDB Endowment 21508097/14/10.",,"Algorithms; Amphibious vehicles; Branch and bound method; Forestry; Integer programming; Roads and streets; Taxicabs; Vehicles; Branch-and-bound algorithms; Dynamic request; Efficient scheduling; Integer programing; Occupancy rate; Personal vehicles; Service guarantees; Tree algorithms; Scheduling algorithms; Energy; Networks; Problem Solving; Roads",,,,,"Abraham, I., Delling, D., Goldberg, A.V., Werneck, R.F., A hub-based labeling algorithm for shortest paths in road networks (2011) Proceedings of the 10th Intl.

In a single-depot network, the deliveries from each depot are planned for that depot only, and drivers return to the starting depot to pick up each new order. In a multidepot network, the deliveries from multiple depots can be planned simultaneously; therefore, a logistics service provider can efficiently combine its resources, thus reducing its labor and transport costs. However, an increasing emphasis on reliability, customization, and flexibility is affecting the logistics structures. This paper describes the shift from single-depot planning to multidepot planning for Nabuurs B.V., a large Benelux logistics service provider that implemented a centralized, automated multidepot planning process throughout its organization. We developed a simulation model to evaluate system performance and to address performance challenges. In this paper, we discuss the results of extensive simulation tests and the specific recommendations that Nabuurs B.V. management implemented. © 2014 INFORMS.","Applications; Distribution; Multidepot planning",,,,,,"Banks, J., Introduction to simulation (1999) Proc. 1999 Winter Simulation Conf., pp. 7-13. , Farrington PA, Nembhard HB, Sturrock DT, Evans GW, eds.

The aim is to find a set of routes, each assigned to a vehicle, in order to satisfy the set of requests, under capacity, time windows, precedence and pairing conditions. It is usually assumed that the demand of a request, picked up at its origin, is exactly delivered at its destination (one-to-one service) and that the fleet of the vehicles is based at a single depot. From a modelling point of view, the problem could be addressed as a one-to-one capacitated Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (PDPTW) and therefore, the mathematical formulation presents, beyond the traditional capacity constraints on the vehicles, also the pairing, the precedence and the time windows conditions. In particular, the pairing conditions guarantee that each couple (pickup, delivery) has to belong to the same route while the precedence constraints impose that each pickup has to be served before the associated delivery. This paper addresses the problem with the aim of optimizing, at the same time, the maximum total ride time and the total waiting time. Then, a bi-objective PDPTW with a constraint on the maximum duration of each route is proposed and solved by a two-step approach. In particular, the first step determines a set of feasible routes by meta-heuristics. These routes are used in second step in a bi-objective set partitioning formulation solved by the epsilon-constraint method to generate efficient solutions. The parameters of the meta-heuristics are properly set by a racing procedure. Computational experiments on some benchmark instances are carried out to assess the performance of the proposed approach. © 2014 The Authors.","Epsilon-constraint Method; Multi-objective Programming; Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows; Racing Methods; Vehicle Routing",,,,,,"Birattari, M., Stützle, T., Paquete, L., Varrentrapp, K., A racing algorithm for configuring metaheuristic (2002) GECCO '02: Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference, pp. 11-18; Chevrier, R., Liefooghe, A., Jourdan, L., Dhaenens, C., Solving a dial-a-ride problem with a hybrid evolutionary multi-objective approach: Application to demand responsive transport (2012) Applied Soft Computing Journal, 12 (4); Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B, 37, pp. 579-594; Cordeau, J.F., A Branch-and-Cut Algorithm for the Dial-a-Ride Problem (2006) Operations Research, 54, pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem: Models and algorithms (2007) Annals of Operations Research, 153, pp. 29-46; Diana, M., Dessouky, M.M., A new regret insertion heuristic for solving large-scale dial-a-ride problems with time windows (2004) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 38 (6), pp. 539-557; Grandinetti, L., Guerriero, F., Pezzella, F., Pisacane, O., The Multi-objective Multi-vehicle Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (2014) Procedia- Social and Behavioral Sciences, 111, pp. 203-212; Guerriero, F., Bruni, M.E., Greco, F., A hybrid greedy randomized adaptive search heuristic to solve the dial-a-ride problem (2013) Asia-Pacific Journal of Operational Research, 30 (1); Hosny, M.I., Mumford, C.L., Single vehicle pickup and delivery with time windows: Made to measure genetic encoding and operators (2007) Proceedings of the 2007 GECCO Conference Companion on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation, pp. 2489-2496. , ACM Press New York, NY, USA; Hosny, M.I., Mumford, C.L., The single vehicle pickup and delivery problem with time windows: Intelligent operators for heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms (2010) Journal of Heuristics, 16 (3), pp. 417-439; Jorgensen, R.M., Larsen, J., Bergvinsdottir, K.B., Solving the Dial-a-Ride Problem Using Genetic Algorithms (2007) The Journal of the Operational Research Society, 58 (10), pp. 1321-1331; Kirchler, D., Wolfler Calvo, R., A Granular Tabu Search algorithm for the Dial-a-Ride Problem (2013) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 56, pp. 120-135; Liao, X.-L., Ting, C.-K., Solving the bi-objective selective pickup and delivery problem with memetic algorithm (2013) Proceedings of the 2013 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Production and Logistics, pp. 107-114; Li, H., Lim, A., A Metaheuristic for the Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (2003) International Journal on Artificial Intelligence Tools, 12 (2), pp. 173-186; Madsen, O.B.G., Ravn, H.F., Rygaard, J.M., A heuristic algorithm for a dial-a-ride problem with time windows, multiple capacities, and multiple objectives (1995) Annals of Operations Research, 60, pp. 193-208; Masson, R., Lehuédé, F., Péton, O., The dial-a-ride problem with transfers (2014) Computers and Operations Research, 41 (1), pp. 12-23; Muelas, S., Latorre, A., Peña, J.-M., A variable neighborhood search algorithm for the optimization of a dial-a-ride problem in a large city (2013) Expert Systems with Applications, 40 (14), pp. 5516-5531; Paquette, J., Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., Quality of service in dial-a-ride operations (2009) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 56 (4), pp. 1721-1734; Paquette, J., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Pascoal, M.M.B., Combining multicriteria analysis and tabu search for dial-a-ride problems (2013) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 52, pp. 1-16; Parragh, S.N., Doerner, K.F., Hartl, R.F., A survey on pickup and delivery problems I.

In Vitória, users submit pickup and delivery requests for transportation between various origins and destinations with time windows for the pickup and delivery; these requests are serviced by a homogeneous fleet of vehicles based at the same depot. The aim is to plan a set of vehicle routes to service all requests while minimizing the transportation cost (commonly length or travel times), the number of vehicles used and the total waiting time inside the vehicles, under constraints such as vehicle capacities and precedence (the origin of a user must precede his/her destination on the route). Our CS was able to handle the particularities present in Vitória. Good computational results are reported for practical instances provided by the Department of Transportation, Traffic and Urban Infrastructure of Vitória.","Clustering search; Dial-a-ride; Multicriteria",,,,,,"Armstrong, G.R., Garfinkel, R.S., Dynamic programming solution of the single and multiple vehicle pickup and delivery problem with application to dial-a-ride, , Universidade do Tennessee, 1982.

On the other hand, to increase their competitiveness on the market, companies are asked to consider preferences of the customers as well. Therefore, tools for logistics management need to manage collective resources, as many depots and heterogeneous fleets, providing flexible preference handling at the same time. In this paper we tackle a pickup and delivery vehicle routing problem involving such aspects; customers place preferences on visiting time (represented as soft time windows), and their violation is allowed at a price. Our interest in this problem stems from an ongoing industrial project. First we propose an exact branch-and-price algorithm, having as a core advanced dynamic programming techniques. Then we analyze through a computational campaign the impact of soft time windows management on the optimal solution in terms of both routing and overall distribution costs. Our experiments show that our approach can solve instances of real size, and clarify the practical usefulness of soft time windows management. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg and Mathematical Optimization Society 2013.",,"Algorithms; Costs; Dynamic programming; Branch-and-price algorithms; Cost of transportation; Heterogeneous fleet; Industrial projects; Logistics management; Pickup and delivery; Pickup and delivery problems; Transportation enterprise; Integer programming",,,,,"Achterberg, T., (2007) Constraint Integer Programming., , PhD thesis, Technische Universität Berlin; Balakrishnan, N., Simple heuristics for the vehicle routing problem with soft time windows (1993) J.

In this article we assume that the customer is mainly concerned with the drop-off time because it is the most important to the customer. Based on the drop-off time specified by the customer and the customer's location, a pick-up time is calculated and given to the customer by the dispatching office. We base our formulation on a dynamic fuzzy logic approach in which a new request is assigned to a vehicle. The fuzzy logic algorithm chooses the vehicle to transport the customer by seeking to satisfy two objectives. The first reflects the customer's preference and minimizes the time a customer spends in the vehicle, and the second reflects the company's preference and minimizes the distance a vehicle needs to travel to transport the customer. The proposed heuristic algorithm is relatively simple and computationally efficient in comparison with most deterministic algorithms for solving both small and large sized problems. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Dial-a-Ride problem; Fuzzy logic; Transportation","Transportation; Dial-a-ride problem; Fuzzy logic approach; Fuzzy logic",,,,,"Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem: Models and algorithms (2007) Ann.

An interesting factor of our problem is that the quantity and place for pickup and delivery are decision variables in the network. We develop an easy-to-implement heuristic in order to gain an efficient and feasible solution quickly. Then, a local search algorithm based on the variable neighborhood search (VNS) method is developed to improve the performance of the heuristic. Computational results show that the proposed VNS method is able to obtain an optimal or near optimal solution in reasonable time for the formulated problem. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Logistics; Pickup and delivery; Transport; Variable neighborhood search; Vehicle routing","algorithm; car use; computer simulation; logistics; planning system; road transport; transportation planning; transportation system",,,,,"Al-Khayyal, F., Hwang, S.J., Inventory constrained maritime routing and scheduling for multi-commodity liquid bulk, Part I: Applications and model (2007) Eur.

In real-life this operational planning problem is often complicated by several factors. Users may have special requirements (e.g. to be transported in a wheelchair) while service providers operate a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles from multiple depots in their service area. In this paper, a general dial-a-ride problem in which these three real-life aspects may simultaneously be taken into account is introduced: the Multi-Depot Heterogeneous Dial-A-Ride Problem (MD-H-DARP). Both a three- and two-index formulation are discussed. A branch-and-cut algorithm for the standard dial-a-ride problem is adapted to exactly solve small problem instances of the MD-H-DARP. To be able to solve larger problem instances, a new deterministic annealing meta-heuristic is proposed. Extensive numerical experiments are presented on different sets of benchmark instances for the homogeneous and the heterogeneous single depot dial-a-ride problem. Instances for the MD-H-DARP are introduced as well. The branch-and-cut algorithm provides considerably better results than an existing algorithm which uses a less compact formulation. All seven previously unsolved benchmark instances for the heterogeneous dial-a-ride problem could be solved to optimality within a matter of seconds. While computation times of the exact algorithm increase drastically with problem size, the proposed meta-heuristic algorithm provides near-optimal solutions within limited computation time for all instances. Several best known solutions for unsolved instances are improved and the algorithm clearly outperforms current state-of-the-art heuristics for the homogeneous and heterogeneous dial-a-ride problem, both in terms of solution quality and computation time. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Branch-and-cut algorithm; Demand responsive transportation; Deterministic annealing meta-heuristic; Dial-a-ride; Heterogeneous users and vehicles; Vehicle routing","Benchmarking; Fleet operations; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Integer programming; Optimization; Rapid thermal annealing; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Branch-and-cut algorithms; Deterministic annealing; Dial-a-Ride; Heterogeneous users; Meta heuristic algorithm; Meta-heuristic approach; Metaheuristic; Near-optimal solutions; Problem solving; algorithm; design; heuristics; numerical method; transport vehicle",,,,,"Ascheuer, N., Fischetti, M., Grotschel, M., A polyhedral study of the asymmetric traveling salesman problem with time windows (2000) Networks, 36 (2), pp. 69-79; Atahran, A., Lenté, C., T'kindt, V., (2014), doi:10.1002/mcda.1518, A multicriteria dial-a-ride problem with an ecological measure and heterogeneous vehicles.

Though it focuses here on the static versions of Dial and Ride, it takes into account the fact that practical DARP has to be handled according to a dynamical point of view, and even, in some case, in real time contexts. So, the kind of algorithmic solution which is proposed here, aim at making easier to bridge both points of view.

Excellent carpooling strategy may not only economize logistics costs, reduce the traffic jam, but be especially favorable for reducing noise and improving the environment. Thus, a two-stage clustering heuristic strategy is introduced to solve deterministic multi-carpooling problem. In the first stage of the strategy, the conception of matching degree is proposed to guide to assign service requirements to specific vehicle, hence the original problem can be split into several single-vehicle problems. And in the second stage of the strategy, based on priori clustering idea, the number of insertion operations in one single-vehicle matching progress is reduced greatly so as to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. To improve the success rate of matching and reduce total costs, the assignment schema of vehicles is not fixed but adjustable. Heuristic emigration and immigration operators are used in a new distribution when some requirements fail to be assigned or probably lead to long arcs in the last distribution. To verify the validity and practicability of the method, some actual samples are generated based on real map information. Experimental results show the algorithm may not only improve ride success rate greatly, reduce total vehicle costs, but also demonstrate strong practicality.","Emigration and immigration operators; Heuristic algorithms; Matching degree; Multi-carpooling problem; Priori clustering; Two-stage clustering","Heuristic optimization algorithms; Improving the environments; Logistics engineering; Matching degree; Multi-carpooling problem; Priori clustering; Transportation system; Two-stage clustering; Heuristic algorithms; Image matching; Traffic congestion; Vehicles; Cost reduction",,,,,"Ferguson, E., The rise and fall of the american carpool: 1970-1990 (1997) Transportation, 24 (4), pp. 349-376; Dailey, D.J., Loseff, D., Meyers, D., Seattle smart traveler: Dynamic ridematching on the world wide Web (1999) Transportation Research Part C, 7 (1), pp. 17-32; Buliung, R.N., Soltys, K., Bui, R., Catching a ride on the information super-highway: Toward an understanding of internet-based carpool formation and use (2010) Transportation, 37 (6), pp. 849-873; Karaoglan, I., Altiparmak, F., Kara, I., The location-routing problem with simultaneous pickup and delivery: Formulations and a heuristic approach (2012) Omega-International Journal of Management Science, 40 (4), pp. 465-477; Bianchessi, N., Righini, G., Heuristic algorithms for the vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pick-up and delivery (2007) Computers & Operations Research, 34 (2), pp. 578-594; Cordeau, J.F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54 (3), pp. 573-586; Cortes, C.E., Matamala, M., Contardo, C., The pickup and delivery problem with transfers: Formulation and a branch-and-cut solution method (2010) European Journal of Operational Research, 200 (2), pp. 711-724; Parragh, S.N., Introducing heterogeneous users and vehicles into models and algorithms for the dial-a-ride problem (2011) Transportation Research Part C-emerging Technologies, 19 (5), pp. 912-930; Häme, L., An adaptive insertion algorithm for the single-vehicle dial-a-ride problem with narrow time windows (2011) European Journal of Operational Research, 209 (1), pp. 11-22; Zhang, J., He, R., Solving dynamic taxipooling problem with simulated annealing algorithm (2008) Journal of Lanzhou Jiaotong University, 27 (3), pp. 85-88. , in Chinese; Zhai, Y., Yang, J., Lian, J., Path matching algorithm for carpool information retrieval (2007) Computer and Communications, 25 (134), pp. 27-30. , in Chinese; Wang, W., Huang, H., Zhao, Y., Dynamic customer demand VRP with soft time windows based on vehicle sharing (2011) Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems, 17 (5), pp. 1056-1063. , in Chinese; Toth, P., Vigo, D., The granular tabu search and its application to the vehicle routing problem (2003) INFORMS Journal on Computing, 15 (4), pp. 333-346","Shao, Z.; Institute of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong Normal University, Jinan 250014, China; email: shaozegnzhen@163.com",,,,,,,,10001239,,JYYFE,,"Chinese","Jisuanji Yanjiu yu Fazhan",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84888619908

It concerns the delivery of drugs and medical devices from the home care company's pharmacy to patients' homes, delivery of special drugs from a hospital to patients, pickup of bio samples and unused drugs and medical devices from patients. The problem can be considered as a special vehicle routing problem with simultaneous delivery and pickup and time windows, with four types of demands: delivery from depot to patient, delivery from a hospital to patient, pickup from a patient to depot and pickup from a patient to a medical lab. Each patient is visited by one vehicle and each vehicle visits each node at most once. Patients are associated with time windows and vehicles with capacity. Two mixed-integer programming models are proposed. We then propose a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and a Tabu Search (TS) method. The GA is based on a permutation chromosome, a split procedure and local search. The TS is based on route assignment attributes of patients, an augmented cost function, route re-optimization, and attribute-based aspiration levels. These approaches are tested on test instances derived from existing VRPTW benchmarks. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The problem is to affect every new passenger request to one of the vehicles and to design a new route and schedule for this vehicle. This affectation must be done in real time.

This mode allows passengers to be carried to their destinations and this by the reception of set of transportation requests announced by customers. These requests needed to be served from a single depot with different vehicles configurations. The idea is to group a number of passengers in the same vehicle with the respecting of the capacity of each vehicle in order to reduce operational cost with the maintaining of good quality service. In this paper, we will treat the static case of Demand Responsive Transport Problem. A new modelization of the DRT problem is presented aims to optimize the cost and the quality of service. We will propose a new formulation of the problem which is different of others formulations existing in literature.

Despite the great potential, taxi ridesharing, especially with dynamic queries, is not well studied. In this paper, we formally define the dynamic ridesharing problem and propose a large-scale taxi ridesharing service. It efficiently serves real-time requests sent by taxi users and generates ridesharing schedules that reduce the total travel distance significantly. In our method, we first propose a taxi searching algorithm using a spatio-temporal index to quickly retrieve candidate taxis that are likely to satisfy a user query. A scheduling algorithm is then proposed. It checks each candidate taxi and inserts the query's trip into the schedule of the taxi which satisfies the query with minimum additional incurred travel distance. To tackle the heavy computational load, a lazy shortest path calculation strategy is devised to speed up the scheduling algorithm. We evaluated our service using a GPS trajectory dataset generated by over 33,000 taxis during a period of 3 months. By learning the spatio-temporal distributions of real user queries from this dataset, we built an experimental platform that simulates user real behaviours in taking a taxi. Tested on this platform with extensive experiments, our approach demonstrated its efficiency, effectiveness, and scalability. For example, our proposed service serves 25% additional taxi users while saving 13% travel distance compared with no-ridesharing (when the ratio of the number of queries to that of taxis is 6). © 2013 IEEE.",,"Computational loads; Experimental platform; Gps trajectories; Its efficiencies; Large-scale dynamics; Searching algorithms; Social and environmental; Spatiotemporal distributions; Behavioral research; Energy utilization; Taxicabs",,,,,"Attanasio, A., Cordeau, J.F., Ghiani, G., Laporte, G., Parallel tabu search heuristics for the dynamic multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2004) Parallel Computing, 30, pp. 377-387. , March; Baldacci, R., Maniezzo, V., Mingozzi, A., An exact method for the car pooling problem based on Lagrangean column generation (2004) Operations Research, 52 (3), pp. 422-439. , DOI 10.1287/opre.1030.0106; Beaudry, A., Laporte, G., Melo, T., Nickel, S., Dynamic transportation of patients in hospitals (2010) OR Spectrum; Rimantas Benetis, Jensen, S., Karciauskas, G., Saltenis, S., Nearest and reverse nearest neighbor queries for moving objects (2006) The VLDB Journal, 15 (3), pp. 229-249; Calvo, R.W., Colorni, A., An effective and fast heuristic for the dial-a-ride problem (2007) 4OR: A Quarterly Journal of Operations Research, 5, pp. 61-73; Calvo, R.W., De Luigi, F., Haastrup, P., Maniezzo, V., A distributed geographic information system for the daily carpooling problem (2004) Computer Operation Research, , Elsevier Science Ltd; Colorni, A., Righini, G., Modeling and optimizing dynamic dial-a-ride problems (2001) International transactions in operational research, 8 (2), pp. 155-166; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 37, pp. 579-594. , July; Cordeau, J.F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operation Research, 54, pp. 573-586; Delling, D., Goldberg, A.V., Werneck, R.F., Faster Batched Shortest Paths in Road Networks (2011) ATMOS, 20, pp. 52-63. , Germany; Desrochers, M., Lenstra, J., Savelsbergh, M., Soumis, F., Vehicle routing with time windows: Optimization and approximation (1988) Vehicle Routing: Methods and Studies, pp. 65-84. , Amsterdam; D'Orey, P., Fernandes, R., M.

It extends the classical Periodic Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows to three types of demands of patients at home. Demands include transportation of drugs/medical devices between the HHC depot and patients' homes, delivery of special drugs from a hospital to patients, and delivery of blood samples from patients to a lab. The weekly demand of each patient is represented by a set of alternative visit patterns. Daily routing is subject to time window constraints of patients and precedence constraints of hospital and lab visits. The goal is to minimize the maximal routing costs among all routes of the week. Various combinations of tabu search and different local search schemes are used to solve the problem. Numerical results show that local search starting with an infeasible local search with a small probability followed by a feasible local search with high probability performs quite well. © 2013 IEEE.","home health care; local search; patient visit planning; tabu search; vehicle routing","Blood samples; High probability; Local search; Logistics optimization; Numerical results; Periodic vehicle routing problem with time-windows; Precedence constraints; Time window constraint; Hospitals; Tabu search; Vehicle routing; Home health care",,,,,"Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., Mercier, A., A unified tabu search heuristic for vehicle routing problems with time windows (2001) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 52 (8), pp. 928-936; Golden, B.L., Laporte, G., Taillard, D.E., An adaptive memory heuristic for a class of vehicle routing problems with minmax objective (1997) Computers & Operations Research, 24 (5), pp. 445-452; Gendreau, M., A generalized insertion heuristic for the traveling salesman problem with time windows (1998) Operations Research, 46 (3), pp. 330-335; Savelsbergh, M.W.P., Local search in routing problems with time windows (1985) Annals of Operations Research, 4 (1), pp. 285-305; Liu, R., Xie, X., Augusto, V., Rodriguez, C., Heuristic approaches for a special simultaneous pickUp and delivery problem with time windows in home health care industry (2012) Proc.

Spatial harvest scheduling models optimize the binary decisions of cutting or not cutting forest management units in different time period subject to logistical, economic and environmental restrictions. One of the most common constraints requires that the contiguous size of harvest openings (i.e.; clear-cuts) cannot exceed an area threshold in any given time period or over a set of periods called green-up. These so-called adjacency or green-up constraints make the harvest scheduling problem combinatorial in nature and very hard to solve. Our proposed cutting plane algorithm starts with a model without area restrictions and adds constraints only if a violation occurs during optimization. Since violations are less likely if the threshold area is large, the number of constraints is kept to a minimum. The utility of the approach is illustrated by an application, where the landowner needs to assess the cost of forest certification that involves clear-cut size restrictions stricter than what is required by law. We run empirical tests and find that the new method performs best when existing models fail: when the number of units is high or the allowable clear-cut size is large relative to average unit size. Since this scenario is the norm rather than the exception in forestry, we suggest that timber industries would greatly benefit from the method. In conclusion, we describe a series of potential applications beyond forestry. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Large cities are demanding more and more share transportation services with flexible routes, resulting from user dynamic demands. In this study a new algorithm is proposed for solving the problem of computing the best routes that a public transportation company could offer to satisfy a number of customer requests. In this problem, known in the literature as the dial-a-ride problem, a number of passengers has to be transported between pickup and delivery locations trying to minimize the routing costs while respecting a set of pre-specified constraints (maximum pickup time, maximum ride duration and maximum load per vehicle). For optimizing this problem, a new variable neighborhood search has been developed and tested on a set of 24 different scenarios of a large-scale dial-a-ride problem in the city of San Francisco. The results have been compared against two state-of-the-art algorithms of the literature and validated by means of statistical procedures proving that the new algorithm has obtained the best overall results. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Carpooling not only improves vehicle utilization rates, but also reduces logistics costs. In multi-vehicle environment, how to distribute service requirements to proper vehicles should first be considered. In this paper, a heuristic clustering algorithm was developed to solve the grouping progress in a deterministic carpooling problem. The concept of matching degree was proposed based on the characteristics of service requirements and vehicles to distribute requirements to a specific vehicle using heuristic algorithm. Simulation results show that the algorithm significantly improves success ride rates and reduces total vehicle costs.","Carpooling problem; Heuristic clustering algorithm; Matching degree; Service requirement distribution","Carpooling problem; Distribution algorithms; Logistics costs; Matching degree; Multi-vehicles; Service requirements; Specific vehicles; Vehicle utilization; Costs; Heuristic algorithms; Traffic congestion; Vehicles; Clustering algorithms",,,,,"Ferguson, E., The rise and fall of the American carpool: 1970-1990 (1997) Transportation, 24 (4), pp. 349-376; Dailey, D.J., Loseff, D., Meyers, D., Seattle smart traveler: Dynamic ridematching on the World Wide Web (1999) Transportation Research Part C, 7 (1), pp. 17-32; Buliung, R.N., Soltys, K., Bui, R., Catching a ride on the information super-highway: Toward an understanding of internet-based carpool formation and use (2010) Transportation, 37 (6), pp. 849-873; Bianchessi, N., Righini, G., Heuristic algorithms for the vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pick-up and delivery (2007) Computers & Operations Research, 34 (2), pp. 578-594; Cordeau, J.F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54 (3), pp. 573-586; Parragh, S.N., Introducing heterogeneous users and vehicles into models and algorithms for the dial-a-ride problem (2011) Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 19 (5), pp. 912-930; Häme, L., An adaptive insertion algorithm for the single-vehicle dial-a-ride problem with narrow time windows (2011) European Journal of Operational Research, 209 (1), pp. 11-22; Zhang, J., He, R., Solving dynamic taxipooling problem with simulated annealing algorithm (2008) Journal of Lanzhou Jiaotong University, 27 (3), pp. 85-88. , in Chinese; Wang, W., Huang, H., Zhao, Y., Dynamic customer demand VRP with soft time windows based on vehicle sharing (2011) Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems, 17 (5), pp. 1056-1063. , in Chinese","Wang, H.; Institute of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong Normal University, Jinan 250014, China; email: wang666666@126.com",,,,,,,,10000054,,QDXKE,,"Chinese","Qinghua Daxue Xuebao",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879719752

Demand-responsive transportation can be used to improve transit service levels in low-demand areas. Because demand in cities can vary significantly across the region and by time of day, an effective means of determining when demand-responsive services can outperform fixed-route services, and vice versa, is needed. This research builds on existing comparison techniques that focus on gridded street systems and expands the techniques to include all types of street networks, transit schedules, and passenger demand levels.

Special needs or medically fragile students are children with special health care needs who are at increased health and safety risk. It is common practice to provide special needs students with specially-equipped buses and/or special classroom environments with specific facilities or services. However, the assignment of student services to schools is regularly made without regard to bus transportation considerations for special needs students. Considering the potentially negative impact of long school bus rides on these students, we present the first systematic, integrated analyses of special needs student busing and classroom assignments.

Pre-specified time windows must be respected, and service levels for passengers as well as operation costs should be optimized. The resulting routing and scheduling problem is NP-hard and can be modeled by a mixed integer linear programming formulation. In this paper, we propose a Granular Tabu Search algorithm for the static Dial-a-Ride Problem with the objective of producing good solutions in a short amount of time (up to 3. min). We evaluate the algorithm on test instances from the literature. Our new algorithm performs well in comparison with a classical Tabu Search algorithm, a Genetic Algorithm, and a Variable Neighborhood Search. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Dial-a-Ride Problem; Granular Tabu Search","Fleet operations;

This paper introduces a new version of the heterogeneous PDP in which the capacity of each vehicle can be modified by reconfiguring its interior to satisfy different types of customer demands. The work was motivated by a daily route planning problem arising at a senior activity center. A fleet of configurable vans is available each day to transport participants to and from the center as well as to secondary facilities for rehabilitative and medical treatment. The number of participants and support equipment that a van can accommodate depends on how it is configured.The problem is modeled as a mixed-integer program much the same way as a PDP but with side constraints that add another level of complexity. To find solutions, we developed a two-phase heuristic that makes use of ideas from greedy randomized adaptive search procedures with multiple starts. In phase I, a set of good feasible solutions is constructed using a series of randomized procedures. A representative subset of those solutions is selected as candidates for improvement by solving a max diversity problem. In phase II, an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) heuristic is used to find local optima by reconstructing portions of the feasible routes. Specialized removal and insertion heuristics were designed for this purpose. Also, a specialized route feasibility check with vehicle type reassignment is introduced to take full advantage of the heterogeneous nature of vehicles. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by comparing the solutions it provided over a period of several weeks with those that were used in practice and derived manually. The analysis indicates that anywhere from 30% to 40% savings can be achieved with the multi-start ALNS heuristic. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Adaptive large neighborhood search; Configurable vehicle capacity; Dial-a-ride problem; Heterogeneous vehicles; Pickup and delivery problem","Customer satisfaction; Integer programming; Optimization; Pickups; Trucks; Adaptive large neighborhood searches; Dial-a-ride problem; Heterogeneous vehicles; Pickup and delivery problems; Vehicle capacity; Vehicles; heuristics; neighborhood; public transport; transport vehicle; transportation planning",,,,,"Baldacci, R., Battarra, M., Vigo, D., Routing a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles (2008) The Vehicle Routing Problem: Latest Advances and New Challenges, pp. 3-27. , Springer, New York, B.L.

The standard DARP objective is cost minimization. In addition to cost, the objectives considered in this paper include three terms related to quality of service. This gives rise to a multicriteria problem. The problem is solved by means of a flexible and simple metaheuristic which efficiently integrates the reference point method for multicriteria optimization within a tabu search mechanism. Extensive tests were performed on randomly generated data and on real-life data provided by a major transporter in the Montreal area. Results indicate that the algorithm can yield a rich set of non-dominated solutions. It can also be employed to determine good trade-offs between cost and quality of service. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Dial-a-ride problem; Multicriteria analysis; Quality of service; Reference point method; Tabu search","Costs; Economic and social effects; Multiobjective optimization; Quality of service; Tabu search; Dial-a-ride problem; Multi Criteria Analysis; Multicriteria optimization; Multicriteria problems; Nondominated solutions; Origin and destinations; Reference point method; Search mechanism; Quality control; algorithm; cost; design; multicriteria analysis; optimization; public transport; trade-off; transport vehicle",,,,,"Alves, M.J., Clímaco, J., An interactive method for 0-1 multiobjective problems using simulated annealing and tabu search (2000) Journal of Heuristics, 6 (3), pp. 385-403; Angel, E., Bampis, E., Gourvés, L., Approximating the Pareto curve with local search for the bicriteria TSP(1,2) problem (2004) Theoretical Computer Science, 310 (1), pp. 135-136; Angel, E., Bampis, E., Gourvés, L., Monnot, J., (Non)-approximability for the multi-criteria TSP(1,2) (2005) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 3623, pp. 329-340. , Springer, Berlin, M.

One of the possible actions towards a solution to this problem is the planning, design and implementation of efficient feeder transit services. This paper develops an analytical model which allows for an easy computation of near optimal terminal-to-terminal cycle length of a demand responsive feeder service to maximize service quality provided to customers, defined as the inverse of a weighted sum of waiting and riding times. The model estimates the recommended cycle length by only plugging in geometrical parameters and demand data, without relying on extensive simulation analyses or rule of thumbs. Simulation experiments and comparisons with real services validate our model, which would allow planners, decision makers and practitioners to quickly identify the best feeder transit operating design of any given residential area. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Continuous approximations; Demand responsive; Feeder transit; First/last mile; Optimal cycle; Transit performance","Decision making; Geometry; Mass transportation; Continuous approximations; Demand responsive; Feeder transit; First/last mile; Optimal cycle; Transit performance; Feeding; computer simulation; numerical model; public transport",,,,,"Ahouissoussi, N.B.C., Wetzstein, M.E., A comparative cost analysis of biodiesel, compressed natural gas, methanol, and diesel for transit bus systems (1998) Resource and Energy Economics, 20 (1), pp. 1-15; Aldaihani, M.M., Quadrifoglio, L., Dessouky, M.M., Hall, R., Network design for a grid hybrid transit service (2004) Transportation Research Part A, 38 (7), pp. 511-530; Alp, O., Erkip, N.K., Güllü, R., Optimal lot-sizing/vehicle-dispatching policies under stochastic lead times and stepwise fixed costs (2003) Operations Research, 51 (1), pp. 160-166; Badami, M.G., Haider, M., An analysis of public bus transit performance in Indian cities (2007) Transportation Research Part A, 41 (10), pp. 961-981; Barr, R.S., Golden, B.L., Kelly, J.P., Resende, M.G.C., Stewart, W.R., Designing and reporting on computational experiments with heuristic methods (1995) Journal of Heuristics, 1 (1), pp. 9-32; Beardwood, J., Halton, J.H., Hammersley, J.M., (1959) The Shortest Path through Many Points.

The problem includes a set of practical complications that have received little attention in the vehicle routing literature. There are multiple vehicle types available to cover a set of transportation orders with different pickup and delivery time windows. Transportation orders and vehicle types must satisfy a set of compatibility constraints. In addition, we include some dock service capacity constraints as required in real-world operations when there are a large number of vehicles to schedule. This problem requires to be attended on large scale instances: transportation orders ≥ 500, single-haul vehicles ≥ 100. Exact algorithms are not suitable for large scale instances. We propose a model to solve the problem in three stages. The first stage constructs initial solutions at the aggregated level relaxing time windows and dock service constraints of the original problem. The other two stages impose time windows and dock service constraints within a cut generation scheme. Our results are favorable in finding good quality solutions in relatively short computational time.","Logistics and transportation planning; PDP-TWDS; Time windows; Vehicle routing optimization",,,,,,"Ascheuer, N., Fischetti, M., Grotschel, M., Solving the asymmetric travelling salesman problem with time windows by branch-and-cut (2001) Mathematical Programming, Series A, 90 (3), pp. 475-506; Cook, W., Rich, J.L., (1999) A Parallel Cutting-plane Algorithm for the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (TR99-04), , Houston, TX: Rice University, Computational and Applied Mathematics; Cordeau, J.F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial - A-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54 (3), pp. 573-586; Desrosiers, J., Dumas, Y., Solomon, M.M., Sournis, F., Time constrained routing and scheduling (1995) Handbooks in Operations Research and Management Science, 8, pp. 35-139. , Network Routing; Dumas, Y., Desrosiers, J., Soumis, F., The pickup and delivery problem with time windows (1991) European Journal of Operational Research, 54 (1), pp. 7-22; Dumas, Y., Desrosiers, J., Solomon, M., An optimal algorithm for the traveling salesman problem with Time Windows (1995) Operations Research, 43 (2), pp. 367-371; Lu, Q., Dessouky, M.M., A new insertion-based construction heuristic for solving the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2006) European Journal of Operational Research, 175 (2), pp. 672-687; Palmgren, M., (2001) Optimisation Methods for Log Truck Scheduling, , PhD Thesis, Linköpings Universitet, Linköping, Sweden; Parragh, S.N., Doerner, K.F., Hartl, R.F., A survey on pickup and delivery problems.

Such growth has congested the limited road space and significantly affected the quality of life in these mega cities. Convincing residents to give up their cars and use public transport is the most effective way in reducing congestion, however, even with sufficient public transport capacity, the lack of last-mile (from the transport hub to the destination) travel services is the major deterrent for the adoption of public transport. Due to the dynamic nature of such travel demands, fixed-size fleets will not be a cost-effective approach in addressing last-mile demands. Instead, we propose a dynamic, incentive-based mechanism that enables taxi ride-sharing for satisfying last-mile travel demands. On the demand side, travelers would register their last-mile travel demands in real-time, and they are expected to receive ride arrangements before they reach the hub, on the supply side, depending on the real-time demands, proper incentives will be computed and provided to taxi drivers willing to commit to the last-mile service. Multiple travelers will be clustered into groups according to their destinations, and travelers belonging to the same group will be assigned to a taxi, while each of them paying fares considering their destinations and also their orders in reaching destinations. In this paper, we provide mathematical formulations for demand clustering and fare distribution. If the model returns a solution, it is guaranteed to be implement able. For cases where it is not possible to satisfy all demands despite having enough capacity, we propose a two-phase approach that identifies the maximal subset of riders that can be feasibly served. Finally, we use a series of numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. © 2012 IEEE.","ride sharing mechanism; urban transportation","Cost-effective approach; Dynamic nature; Mathematical formulation; Numerical example; Public transport; Quality of life; Ride-sharing; Travel services; Intelligent agents; Taxicabs; Traffic congestion; Transportation; Urban transportation; Dynamics",,,,,"Cordeau, J.-F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54 (3), pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem (DARP): Variants, modeling issues and algorithms (2003) 4OR: A Quarterly Journal of Operations Research, 1, pp. 89-101. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10288-002-0009-8, [Online].

The vehicle contains a number of (horizontal) stacks of finite capacity for loading items from the rear of the vehicle. Each stack must satisfy the last-in-first-out constraint that states that any new item must be loaded on top of a stack and any unloaded item must be on top of its stack. A branch-and-cut algorithm is proposed for solving this problem. Computational results are reported on different types of randomly generated instances as well as on classical instances for some well-known special cases of the problem. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Generalizing from previous work in oversubscribed task scheduling, we define a controlled iterative repair search procedure for finding an alternative set of vehicle itineraries in which the overall solution has been feasibly extended to include newly received requests. We first evaluate the performance of this technique on a set of DARP feasibility benchmark problems from the literature. We then consider its use on a real-world DARP problem, where it is necessary to accommodate all requests and constraints must be relaxed when a request cannot be feasibly integrated. For this latter analysis, we introduce a constraint relaxation post processing step and consider the performance impact of using our controlled iterative search over the current greedy search approach.

The demand responsive transport systems (DRTS) seem to be the solution for the trade-off between flexibility and efficiency. They require the planning of travel paths (routing) and customers pick-up and drop-off times (scheduling) according to received requests and respecting the limited capacity of the fleet and time constraints (hard time windows) for each network's node. Even considering invariable conditions of the network a DRTS may operate according to a static or to a dynamic mode. In the dynamic mode, customers' requests arrive when the service is already running and, consequently, the solution may change over time. In this work, we use an algorithm able to solve a dynamic multi-vehicle DaRP by managing incoming transport demand as fast as possible. The heuristics is a greedy method that tries to assign the requests to one of the fleet's vehicles finding each time the local optimum. The usage of vehicles only when strictly necessary, provides to costs minimization. The work is enriched by a series of tests with different values of the fleet's vehicles and their capacity, of time windows and of incoming requests' number. The solutions provided by the heuristics are simulated in a discrete events environment in which it's possible to reproduce the movement of the buses, the passengers' arrival to the stops, and in the next step the delays due to the traffic congestion and possible anomalies in the behaviour of the passengers. Finally, at the end of the simulation, a set of performance indicators evaluate the solution planned by the heuristics. © 2012 IFAC.","Demand responsive transport systems; Dial-a-Ride Problem; Discrete event simulation; Heuristics; Public transport","Demand responsive transport systems; Dial-a-ride problem; Discrete events; Dynamic modes; Greedy method; Heuristics; Limited capacity; Local optima; Multi-vehicles; Performance indicators; Public transport; Time constraints; Time windows; Transport demand; Transport systems; Benchmarking; Costs; Discrete event simulation; Fleet operations; Manufacture; Traffic congestion; Transportation",,,,,"Aldaihani, M., Dessouky, M.M., Hybrid scheduling methods for paratransit operations (2003) Computers and Industrial Engineering, 45, pp. 75-96; Beaudry, A., Laporte, G., Melo, T., Nickel, S., Dynamic transportation of patients to hospitals (2010) OR Spectrum, 32, pp. 77-107; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., Dynamic pickup and delivery problems (2010) European Journal of Operational Research, 202, pp. 8-15; Bergvinsdottir, K.B., Larsen, J., Jørgensen, R.M., Solving the dial-a-ride problem using genetic algorithms (2004) IMM-technical Report-2004-20, Informatics and Mathematical Modelling, , Technical University of Denmark; Bodin, L.D., Sexton, T., The multi-vehicle subscriber dial-a-ride problem (1986) TIMS Studies in Management Science, 2, pp. 73-86; Borndörfer, R., Klostermeier, F., Grötschel, M., Küttner, C., Telebus berlin: Vehicle scheduling in a dial-a-ride system (1997) Technical Report SC 97-23, Konrad-zuse-zentrum für Informationstechnik, , Berlin; Brotcorne, L., Laporte, G., Semet, F., Ambulance location and relocation models (2003) European Journal of Operational Research, 147, pp. 451-468; Brown, F., Harris, M.G., Other, A.N., Name of paper (1998) Name of Book in Italics, , Name(s) of editor(s) (ed.) page numbers.

FTS aim to provide passengers with flexibility in choosing routes, times, modes of transport, service provider and payment systems. In order to achieve this additional flexibility, a well-designed FTS integrate different modes of transport, possibly spanning multiple service providers, to provide more sophisticated, comfortable and cost-effective transport opportunities. The concept of flexible transport is not new; many existing systems, including shared taxicabs, Dial-A-Ride services, and car-clubs, contain elements of such a system. In this paper, we concentrate on FTS within rural areas, which generally suffer from lack of service availability and demand uncertainties, and for which existing FTS solutions are not well suited. We present an agent-based flexible transport systems platform developed using argumentation theory. Formal argumentation is a powerful technique borrowed from artificial intelligence, and in this context is used to weigh-up the conflicting choices available to both passengers and service providers. The resultant platform for FTS in rural areas acts as a virtual transport market place that would more effectively match existing demand and supply for transport services than existing solutions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Argumentation theory; Flexible transport systems; Rural transport",,,,,,"Ambrosino, G., Logi, F., Sassoli, P., EBusiness Applications to flexible transport and mobility services (2001) Eunite Einite conference, Tenerife, Spain, December 2001; Attanasio, A., Cordeau, J.F., Ghiani, G., Laporte, G., Parallel Tabu search heuristics for the dynamic multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2004) Parallel Computing, 30, pp. 377-387; Baroni, P., Giacomin, M., On principle-based evaluation of extension-based argumentation semantics (2007) Artificial Intelligence, 171 (10-15), pp. 675-700; Bent, R., Van Hentenryck, P., A two-stage hybrid algorithm for pickup and delivery vehicle routing problems with time windows (2006) Computers and Operations Research, 33 (4), pp. 875-893; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A hybrid Tabu search and constraint programming algorithm for the dynamic dial-a-ride problem (2010) CIRRELT Report; Chen, S., Tsai, F., Generating fuzzy rules from training instances for fuzzy classification systems (2008) Expert Systems with Applications, 35, pp. 611-621; Cordeau, J.-F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54, pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J.-F., Gendreau, M., Laporte, G., A Tabu search heuristic for periodic and multi-depot vehicle routing problems (1997) Networks, 30, pp. 105-119; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem: variants, modeling issues and algorithms (2002) Journal of the Belgian, French and Italian Operations Research Societies, pp. 89-101; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A Tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research B, 37, pp. 579-594; Coslovich, L., Pesenti, R., Ukovich, W., A two-phase insertion technique of unexpected customers for a dynamic dial-a-ride problem (2006) European Journal of Operational Research, 175, pp. 1605-1615; De Weerdt, M.M., van der Krogt, R.P., Witteveen, C., Resource based multi agent plan merging: framework and application (2003) Proceedings of the 22nd Annual Workshop of the UK Planning and Scheduling Special Interest Group, pp. 218-233; Desrosiers, J., Dumas, Y., Soumis, F., A dynamic programming solution of the large-scale single vehicle dial-a-ride problem with time windows (1986) American Journal of Mathematical and Management Sciences, 6, pp. 301-325; Dung, P.M., On the acceptability of arguments and its fundamental role in nonmonotonic reasoning and logic programming and n-person games (1995) Artificial Intelligence, 77, pp. 321-357; Eloranta, P., Masson, B., The FAMS approach in Angus (2004) Demand Responsive Transport Services: Towards the Flexible Mobility Agency, pp. 269-277. , ENEA, Rome, G.

This problem is characterized by the presence of heterogeneous vehicles and patients. In our problem, two types of vehicles are used, each providing a different capacity for four different modes of transportation. Patients may request to be transported either seated, on a stretcher or in a wheelchair. In addition, some may require accompanying persons. The problem is to construct a minimum-cost routing plan satisfying service-related criteria, expressed in terms of time windows, as well as driver-related constraints expressed in terms of maximum route duration limits and mandatory lunch breaks. We introduce both a three-index and a set-partitioning formulation of the problem. The linear programming relaxation of the latter is solved by a column generation algorithm. We also propose a variable neighborhood search heuristic. Finally, we integrate the heuristic and the column generation approach into a collaborative framework. The column generation algorithm and the collaborative framework provide tight lower bounds on the optimal solution values for small-to-medium-sized instances. The variable neighborhood search algorithm yields high-quality solutions for realistic test instances. © 2010 The Author(s).","Column generation; Dial-a-ride-problem; Passenger transportation; Variable neighborhood search",,,,,,"Beaudry, A., Laporte, G., Melo, T., Nickel, S., Dynamic transportation of patients to hospitals (2009) OR Spectrum, 32, pp. 77-107; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Gribkovskaia, I., Laporte, G., Static pickup and delivery problems: a classification scheme and survey (2007) Top, 15, pp. 1-31; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Dynamic pickup and delivery problems (2010) Eur J Oper Res, 202, pp. 8-15; Černy, V., Thermodynamical approach to the traveling salesman problem: An efficient simulation algorithm (1985) J Opt Theory Appl, 45, pp. 41-51; Cordeau, J.-F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Oper Res, 54, pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transport Res B Meth, 37, pp. 579-594; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem: models and algorithms (2007) Ann Oper Res, 153, pp. 29-46; Danna, E., Lepape, C., Branch-and-price heuristics: a case study on the vehicle routing problem with time windows (2005) Column Generation, pp. 99-129. , G.

The system simulates the operation of a dynamic dial-a-ride service that operates with multiple fleets of vehicles with different capacities, schedules and depots. It can be used to investigate how the setting of service and cost parameters and the design of the service affect the total cost for the operator and level of service for the customer.

The hybrid algorithm combines an exact constraint programming algorithm and a tabu search heuristic. An important component of the tabu search heuristic consists of three scheduling procedures that are executed sequentially. Experiments show that the constraint programming algorithm is sometimes able to accept or reject incoming requests, and that the hybrid method outperforms each of the two algorithms when they are executed alone.","Constraint programming; Dial-a-ride problem; Dynamic; Scheduling; Tabu search","Constraint programming; Dial-a-ride problem; Exact constraint; Hybrid algorithms; Hybrid method; Hybrid tabu search; Real time; Service requests; Tabu Search heuristic; Computer programming; Constraint theory; Dynamics; Heuristic algorithms; Scheduling; Tabu search",,,,,"Attanasio, A., Cordeau, J.-F., Ghiani, G., Laporte, G., Parallel tabu search heuristics for the dynamic multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2004) Parallel Comput., 30 (3), pp. 377-387; Beaudry, A., Laporte, G., Melo, T., Nickel, S., Dynamic transportation of patients in hospitals (2010) OR Spectrum, 32 (1), pp. 77-107; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Dynamic pickup and delivery problems (2010) Eur.

There is, however, little in the literature on effective models and solution methods for solving the taxi pooling problem. Thus, in this study we employ network flow techniques and a mathematical programming method to develop a taxi pooling solution method. This method is composed of three models. First, a fleet routing/scheduling model is constructed to produce fleet/passenger routes and schedules. A solution algorithm, based on Lagrangian relaxation, a sub-gradient method and a heuristic to find the upper bound of the solution, is proposed to solve the fleet routing/scheduling model. Then, two single taxi-passenger matching models are constructed with the goals of decreasing number of passenger transfers and matching all passengers and taxis. These two taxi-passenger matching models are directly solved using a mathematical programming solver. For comparison with the solution method, we also develop another heuristic by modifying a heuristic recently proposed for solving a one-to-many taxi pooling problem. The performance of the solution method and the additional heuristic are evaluated by carrying out a case study using real data and suitable assumptions. The test results show that these two solution methods could be useful in practice. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Lagrangian relaxation; Mathematical programming; Multiple commodity network flow problem; Multiple origins/destinations; Taxi pooling","Experience-based methods; LaGrangian relaxation; Matching models; Multiple commodity network flow problem; Multiple origins/destinations; Network flow techniques; Pooling problem; Solution algorithms; Solution methods; Taxi pooling; Three models; Upper Bound; Gradient methods; Lagrange multipliers; Mathematical programming; Taxicabs; Heuristic methods; algorithm; heuristics; Lagrangian analysis; numerical method; taxi transport; Taiwan",,,,,"Aldaihani, M., Dessouky, M., Hybrid scheduling methods for paratransit operations (2003) Comput.

Constraints in rural transport infrastructure and services are often compounded by limitations in the development and resilience of technological infrastructures. In this context there is significant disparity between urban and rural communities.This paper will examine the context for accessibility and connectivity in rural communities highlighting key transport and technology challenges. It also explores barriers and opportunities to bringing together transport and technology solutions to enhance rural accessibility and connectivity. This is an area where current understanding is weak as most research has been focussed on urban environments. The paper focuses specifically on two issues of current research; firstly, the role of information and associated technologies in supporting rural passengers on public transport, secondly, the use of technologies to support flexible and demand responsive transport services in rural areas. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Accessibility and connectivity; Rural communities; Transport technologies","accessibility; poverty; rural population; rural transport; transportation infrastructure; transportation technology",,,,,"Ambrosino, G., Logi, F., Sassoli, P., (2001), eBusiness Applications to Flexible Transport and Mobility Services.

A potential solution for this problem is the use of car polling systems, which support the process of car sharing among users. However, current systems only work as a channel where providers and consumers can arrange shared cars for public transport. This work extends this idea via the use of DARP (Dial-a-Ride Problem) and metaheuristic concepts so that the allocation of rides can be carried out in an autonomous and dynamic way. The main aim of this approach is to optimize and facilitate the sharing process of personal cars, so that the number of vehicles in the roads can be reduced together with all the problems that such vehicles raise on. © 2005 IEEE.","DARP; Metaheuristics; Optimization","Car pooling; Current system; DARP; Dial-a-ride problem; Meta heuristics; Metaheuristic; Number of vehicles; Polling system; Potential solutions; Public transport; Traffic jams; Emergency traffic control; Traffic congestion; Optimization",,,,,"Hennessy, D.A., Wiesenthal, D.L., Kohn, P.M., The influence of traffic congestion, daily hassles, and trait stress susceptibility on state driver stress: An interactive perspective (2000) Journal of Applied Biobehavioral Research, 5 (2), pp. 162-179; Vlacic, L., Parent, M., Harashima, F., (2001) Telligent Vehicle Technologies, , London: Butterworth-Heinemann; Parent, M., Automated public vehicles : A first step towards the automated highway (1997) Proceedings of 4th World Congress on Intelligent Transport Systems, , Berlin, Germany; Bodin, L.D., Sexton, T., The multi-vehicle subscriber dial-a-ride problem (1986) TIMS Studies in Management Science, 2, pp. 73-86; Baber, J., Kolodko, J., Noel, T., Parent, M., Vlacic, L., Cooperative autonomous driving - Intelligent vehicles sharing city roads (2005) IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine, 12 (1), pp. 44-49; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 37 (6), pp. 579-594; Mauri, G.B., Novas Abordagens para Representação e Obtenção de Limitantes e Soluções para Alguns Problemas de Otimização Combinatória (2008) Tese de Doutorado em Computação Aplicada, , Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais - INPE; (2011), http://www-01.ibm.com/software/integration/optimization/cplex-optimizer/, IBM IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimizer Disponível em; Cordeau, J.F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54 (3), pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., The Dial-a-Ride Problem (DARP): Variants, modeling issues and algorithms (2003) Quarterly Journal of the Belgian, French and Italian Operations Research Societies, 1 (2), pp. 89-101; Jorgensen, R.M., Bergvinsdottir, K.B., Larsen, J., Solving the diala-ride problem using genetic algorithms (2006) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 58 (10), pp. 1321-1331; Glover, F., Kochenberger, G., (2003) Handbook of Metaheuristics, , Springer, New York, Boston, Dordrecht, London, Moscow; Souza, M.J.F., (2009) Teligência Computacional Para Otimização, , Ouro Preto, MG; Silva, M.S.A., Mine, M.T., Ochi, L.S., Busca Local Iterada Aplicada ao Problema de Programação de Jogos Realizados em Dois Turnos Espelhados (2006) Anais Do XXXVIII Simpósio Brasileiro de Pesquisa Operacional; Silva, M.S., (2009) Problema de Recobrimento de Rotas Com Coleta de Prêmios, , Dissertação de Mestrado, Universidade Federal Fluminense, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil; Kumar, V., Algorithms for Constraint-satisfaction problems: A Survey (1992) AI Magazine, 13 (1), pp. 32-44; Ghallab, M., Nau, D., Traverso, P., (2004) Automated Planning: Theory and Practice, , Morgan Kaufmann Publishers","Leite Viana Costa, D.; Universidade Federal da Paraiba (UFPB), Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil; email: dlvcpe@gmail.com",,,,,,,,15480992,,,,"Portuguese","IEEE.

In this paper, we develop an insertion heuristic that economically inserts the deviation requests into the schedule for multiple-vehicle MAST system, which has never been addressed in the literature. The proposed heuristic is validated and evaluated by a set of simulations performed at different demand levels and with different control parameters. By comparing its performance versus the optimal solutions, the effectiveness and quality of the heuristic is confirmed. Compared to its single-vehicle counterpart, the multiple-vehicle MAST prevails in terms of rejection rate, passenger waiting time and overall objective function, among other performance indices. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Control parameters; Objective functions; Optimal solutions; Passenger waiting time; Performance indices; Rejection rates; Transit systems; Vehicle mobility; Intelligent systems; Optimal systems; Vehicles",,,,,"Koffman, D., (2004) Operational Experiences with Flexible Transit Services: A Synthesis of Transit Practice, p. 53. , Transportation Research Board, Washington DC, TCRP Synthesis; Quadrifoglio, L., Hall, R.W., Dessouky, M.M., Performance and design of mobility allowance shuttle transit services: Bounds on the maximum longitudinal velocity (2006) Transportation Science, 40 (3), pp. 351-363. , http://www.atypon-link.com/INF/doi/pdf/10.1287/trsc.1050.0137, DOI 10.1287/trsc.1050.0137; Quadrifoglio, L., Dessouky, M.M., Palmer, K., An insertion heuristic for scheduling Mobility Allowance Shuttle Transit (MAST) services (2007) Journal of Scheduling, 10 (1), pp. 25-40. , DOI 10.1007/s10951-006-0324-6; Quadrifoglio, L., Dessouky, M.M., Sensitivity analyses over the service area for mobility allowance shuttle transit (mast) services (2008) Lecture Notes in Economics and Mathematical Systems, 600, pp. 419-432. , Computer-aided Systems in Public Transport, ser; Zhao, J., Dessouky, M., Service capacity design problems for mobility allowance shuttle transit systems (2008) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 42 (2), pp. 135-146. , DOI 10.1016/j.trb.2007.07.002, PII S0191261507000732; Cordeau, J.-F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54 (3), pp. 573-586; Lu, Q., Dessouky, M., An exact algorithm for the multiple vehicle pickup and delivery problem (2004) Transportation Science, 38, pp. 503-514. , November; Corts, C.E., Matamala, M., Contardo, C., The pickup and delivery problem with transfers: Formulation and a branch-and-cut solution method (2010) European Journal of Operational Research, 200 (3), pp. 711-724; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Dynamic pickup and delivery problems (2010) European Journal of Operational Research, 202 (1), pp. 8-15; Quadrifoglio, L., Dessouky, M.M., Ordonez, F., Mobility allowance shuttle transit (MAST) services: MIP formulation and strengthening with logic constraints (2008) European Journal of Operational Research, 185 (2), pp. 481-494. , DOI 10.1016/j.ejor.2006.12.030, PII S0377221707000288; Psaraftis, H.N., A dynamic programming solution to the single vehicle many-to-many immediate request dial-a-ride problem (1980) Transportation Science, 14 (2), pp. 130-154; Psaraftis, H.N., An exact algorithm for the single vehicle many-to-many dial-a-ride problem with time windows (1983) Transportation Science, 17 (3), pp. 351-357; Lenstra, J.K., Kan, A.H.G.R., Complexity of vehicle routing and scheduling problems (1981) Networks, 11 (2), pp. 221-227; Campbell, A.M., Savelsbergh, M., Efficient insertion heuristics for vehicle routing and scheduling problems (2004) Transportation Science, 38 (3), pp. 369-378; Savelsbergh, M.W.P., Sol, M., The general pickup and delivery problem (1995) Transportation Science, 29 (1), pp. 17-29; Lu, Q., Dessouky, M.M., A new insertion-based construction heuristic for solving the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2006) European Journal of Operational Research, 175 (2), pp. 672-687. , DOI 10.1016/j.ejor.2005.05.012, PII S0377221705004698","Lu, W.; Zachry Department of Civil Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX 77843-3136, United States",,"IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Society (ITS);George Washington Univ.

Cargo flows are given by an origin/destination matrix which is not necessarily symmetric. This problem is a generalization of several known pickup and delivery problems, as regards both problem structure and objective function. Solution approaches are developed for the single-vehicle and two-vehicle cases. The fact that for each cargo that goes from a node i to another node j there may be a cargo going in the opposite direction provides the motivation for the two-vehicle case, because one may conceivably consider solutions where no cargoes that travel in opposite directions between node pairs are carried by the same vehicle. Yet, it is shown that such scenarios are generally sub-optimal. As expected, the computational effort of the single vehicle algorithm is exponential in the number of cargoes. For the two-vehicle case, said effort is of an order of magnitude that is not higher than that of the single-vehicle case. Some rudimentary examples are presented or both the single-vehicle and two-vehicle cases so as to better illustrate the method. © 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The model is formulated as a special integer multiple-commodity network flow problem. A Lagrangian relaxation-based algorithm is also developed to solve the model. The performance of the heuristic algorithm is evaluated by carrying out a case study using real data and suitable assumptions. The test results confirm the usefulness of the model and the heuristic algorithm and that they could be useful in practice. © 2011 IEEE.","Lagrangian relaxation; many-to-many car pooling problem; multiple commodity network flow problem; network","Car pooling; Lagrangian; LaGrangian relaxation; multiple commodity network flow problem; Network flow problems; Network flow techniques; Origin and destinations; Private vehicles; Heuristic algorithms; Lagrange multipliers; Networks (circuits); Mathematical models",,,,,"Baldacci, R., Maniezzo, V., Mingozzi, A., An exact method for the car pooling problem based on Lagrangian column generation (2004) Oper.

Although car pooling is becoming more common, in practice, participant matching results are still being obtained by an inefficient manual approach, which may possibly result in an inferior solution. In the past, when car pooling studies have been done the problem has been treated as either a to-work problem (from different origins to the same destination) or return-from-work problem (from the same origin to different destinations). However, in this study we employ a time-space network flow technique to develop a model for the many-to-many car pooling problem with multiple vehicle types and person types. The model is formulated as an integer multiple commodity network flow problem. Since real problem sizes can be huge, it could be difficult to find optimal solutions within a reasonable period of time. Therefore, we develop a solution algorithm based on Lagrangian relaxation, a subgradient method, and a heuristic for the upper bound solution, to solve the model. To test how well the model and the solution algorithm can be applied to real world, we randomly generated several examples based upon data reported from a past study carried out in northern Taiwan, on which we performed numerical tests. The test results show the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution algorithm. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Car pooling; Lagrangian relaxation; Many-to-many; Multiple commodity network flow problem;

The problem arises from an on-demand transportation system developed in a rural zone in France, where the objective of encouraging people meeting is pursued. We address the solution of the problem with a column generation approach, applied to a set partitioning formulation where the objective function is fractional. Based on the literature on linear fractional programming, two methods are developed to deal with this fractional objective. Experiments permit to compare these two approaches and to evaluate the impact of the new objective compared to a standard min-cost or min-time optimization. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

For solving the problem we embed the suggested evaluation procedure in a pure local search heuristic and in a tabu search heuristic. The quality of the solutions obtained by the two heuristics have been compared experimentally.

In many cases the solution is to realize demand responsive transportation system. A Demand Responsive Transport System (DRTS) requires the planning of travel paths (routing) and customer pick-up and drop-off times (scheduling) according to received requests. In particular, the problem has to deal with multiple vehicles, limited capacity of the fleet vehicles and temporal constraints (time windows). A DRTS may operate according to static or dynamic mode. In the static setting, all the customer requests are known beforehand and the DRTS solves a Dial-a-Ride Problem (DaRP) instance, to produce the tour of each bus, respecting the pick up and delivery time windows while minimising the solution cost. In the dynamic mode, the customer requests arrive overtime to a control station and, consequently, the solution may also change over time. In this work, we address a Demand Responsive Transport System capable of managing incoming transport demand using a two-stage algorithm by solving a DaRP instance. The solutions provided by the heuristics are simulated in a discrete events environment in which it is possible to reproduce the movement of the buses, the passengers' arrival to the stops, the delays due to the traffic congestion and possible anomalies in the behaviour of the passengers. Finally, a set of performance indicators evaluate the solution planned by the heuristics. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Demand Responsive Transport Sistem; Dial-a-Ride Problem; Discrete event simulation; Heuristics",,,,,,"Aldaihani, M., Dessouky, M.M., Hybrid scheduling methods for paratransit operations (2003) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 45, pp. 75-96; Bergvinsdottir, K.B., Larsen, J., Jørgensen, R.M., Solving the dial-a-ride problem using genetic algorithms (2004) IMM-Technical report-2004-20, Informatics and Mathematical Modelling, , Technical University of Denmark; Bodin, L.D., Sexton, T., The multi-vehicle subscriber dial-a-ride problem (1986) TIMS Studies in Management Science, 2, pp. 73-86; Borndörfer, R., Klostermeier, F., Grötschel, M., Küttner, C., (1997) Telebus Berlin: Vehicle Scheduling in A Dial-a-ride System, , Technical report SC 97-23, Konrad-Zuse-Zentrum für Informationstechnik, Berlin; Brotcorne, L., Laporte, G., Semet, F., Ambulance location and relocation models (2003) European Journal of Operational Research, 147, pp. 451-468; Carotenuto, P., Cis, C., Storchi, G., Hybrid genetic algorithm to approach the DaRP in a demand responsive passenger service (2006) INFORMATION CONTROL PROBLEMS in MANUFACTURING 2006 Proceedings of the 12th IFAC International Symposium, 3, pp. 349-354. , Elsevier Science, ISBN: 978-0-08-044654-7; Cis, C., (2004) Logistica Urbana: Algoritmi Genetici Ibridi per la Realizzazione di Servizi Innovativi per Il Trasporto di Persone, , MBA Thesis, University of Rome "" Tor Vergata""; Colorni, A., Righini, G., Modeling and optimizing dynamic dial-a-ride problems (2001) International transactions in operational research, 8 (2), pp. 155-166; Cordeau, J.-F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54 (3), pp. 573-586. , http://www.extenza-eps.com/INF/doi/pdf/10.1287/opre.1060.0283, DOI 10.1287/opre.1060.0283; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 37 (6), pp. 579-594. , DOI 10.1016/S0191-2615(02)00045-0; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem (DaRP): Variants, modeling issues and algorithms (2003) 4OR: A Quarterly Journal of Operations Research, 1, pp. 89-101; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Mercier, A., A unified tabu search heuristic for vehicle routing problems with time windows (2001) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 52 (8), pp. 928-936. , DOI 10.1057/palgrave/jors/2601163; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Potvin, J.-Y., Savelsbergh, M.W.P., Transportation on demand (2007) Transportation, , C.

Athena, Greece","In the dynamic Pickup and Delivery Problem with Transfers (dPDPT), a set of transportation requests that arrive at arbitrary times must be assigned to a fleet of vehicles. We use two cost metrics that capture both the company's and the customer's viewpoints regarding the quality of an assignment. In most related problems, the rule of thumb is to apply a two-phase local search algorithm to heuristically determine a good requests-to-vehicles assignment. This work proposes a novel solution based on a graph-based formulation of the problem that treats each request independently. Briefly, in this conceptual graph, the goal is to find a shortest path from a node representing the pickup location to that of the delivery location. However, we show that efficient Bellman-Ford or Dijkstra-like algorithms cannot be applied. Still, our method is able to find dPDPT solutions significantly faster than a conventional two-phase local search algorithm, while the quality of the solution is only marginally lower. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","dynamic shortest path; Pickup and delivery problem","Bellman-Ford; Conceptual graph; Cost metrics; Dynamic shortest path; Graph-based; Local search algorithm; Novel solutions; Pickup and delivery; Pickup and delivery problem; Pickup and delivery problems; Rule of thumb; Shortest path; Fleet operations; Graph theory; Learning algorithms; Pickups",,,,,"Agrawal, R., Jagadish, H.V., Materialization and incremental update of path information (1989) ICDE, pp. 374-383; Bent, R., Hentenryck, P.V., A two-stage hybrid algorithm for pickup and delivery vehicle routing problems with time windows (2006) Computers and Operations Research, 33 (4), pp. 875-893; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., Dynamic pickup and delivery problems (2010) European Journal of Operational Research, 202 (1), pp. 8-15; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.F., Gribkovskaia, I., Laporte, G., Static pickup and delivery problems: A classification scheme and survey (2007) TOP, 15, pp. 1-31; Carraway, R.L., Morin, T.L., Moskowitz, H., Generalized dynamic programming for multicriteria optimization (1990) European Journal of Operational Research, 44 (1), pp. 95-104; Cheng, J., Yu, J.X., On-line exact shortest distance query processing (2009) EDBT, pp. 481-492; Cohen, E., Halperin, E., Kaplan, H., Zwick, U., Reachability and distance queries via 2-hop labels (2002) SODA, pp. 937-946; Cooke, K.L., Halsey, E., The shortest route through a network with time-dependent internodal transit times (1966) Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications, 14 (3), pp. 493-498; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., Ropke, S., Recent Models and Algorithms for One-to-One Pickup and Delivery Problems (2008) Vehicle Routing: Latest Advances and Challenges, pp. 327-357. , Kluwer, Dordrecht; Cordeau, J.F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54 (3), pp. 573-586; Cortés, C.E., Matamala, M., Contardo, C., The pickup and delivery problem with transfers: Formulation and a branch-and-cut solution method (2010) European Journal of Operational Research, 200 (3), pp. 711-724; Ding, B., Yu, J.X., Qin, L., Finding time-dependent shortest paths over large graphs (2008) EDBT, pp. 205-216; Dreyfus, S.E., An appraisal of some shortest-path algorithms (1969) Operations Research, 17 (3); Dumas, Y., Desrosiers, J., Soumis, F., The pickup and delivery problem with time windows (1991) European Journal of Operational Research, 54 (1), pp. 7-22; Gendreau, M., Guertin, F., Potvin, J.Y., Séguin, R., Neighbourhood search heuristics for a dynamic vehicle dispatching problem with pick-ups and deliveries (2006) Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 14 (3), pp. 157-174; Goldberg, A.V., Harrelson, C., Computing the shortest path: A search meets graph theory (2005) SODA 2005: Proceedings of the Sixteenth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, pp. 156-165; Goldberg, A.V., Kaplan, H., Werneck, R.F., Reach for A*: Efficient point-to-point shortest path algorithms (2006) Proc. of the 8th WS on Algorithm Engineering and Experiments (ALENEX), pp. 129-143. , SIAM, Philadelphia; Granat, J., Guerriero, F., The interactive analysis of the multicriteria shortest path problem by the reference point method (2003) European Journal of Operational Research, 151 (1), pp. 103-118; Guerriero, F., Musmanno, R., Label correcting methods to solve multicriteria shortest path problems (2001) Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications, 111 (3), pp. 589-613; Jing, N., Huang, Y.W., Rundensteiner, E.A., Hierarchical encoded path views for path query processing: An optimal model and its performance evaluation (1998) TKDE, 10 (3), pp. 409-432; Jung, S., Pramanik, S., An efficient path computation model for hierarchically structured topographical road maps (2002) TKDE, 14 (5), pp. 1029-1046; Kriegel, H.P., Renz, M., Schubert, M., Route skyline queries: A multi-preference path planning approach (2010) ICDE, pp. 261-272; Li, H., Lim, A., A metaheuristic for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2001) ICTAI, pp. 333-340; Mitrović-Minić, S., Krishnamurti, R., Laporte, G., Double-horizon based heuristics for the dynamic pickup and delivery problem (2004) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 38 (7), pp. 669-685; Mitrović-Minić, S., Laporte, G., Waiting strategies for the dynamic pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2004) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 38 (7), pp. 635-655; Mitrović-Minić, S., Laporte, G., The pickup and delivery problem with time windows and transshipment (2006) INFOR, 44 (3), pp. 217-228; Orda, A., Rom, R., Shortest-path and minimum-delay algorithms in networks with time-dependent edge-length (1990) J.

A mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation for the static scheduling problem of multi-vehicle MAST (m-MAST) system is proposed in this paper. Based on the MIP formulation, we analyze the impacts of time headways between consecutive transit vehicles on the performance of a two-vehicle MAST system. An analytical framework is then developed to model the performance of both one-vehicle and two-vehicle MAST systems, which is used to identify the critical demand level at which an increase of the fleet size from one to two vehicles would be appropriate. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to find out the impact of a key modeling parameter w1 on the critical demand. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Analytical model; Fleet sizes; Key modeling; Mixed-integer programming; Multi-vehicles; Static scheduling; Time headway; Transit systems; Transit vehicles; Integer programming; Mass transportation; Mathematical models; Sensitivity analysis; Vehicles; Fleet operations",,,,,"Koffman, D., Operational experiences with flexible transit services: A synthesis of transit practice (2004) Transportation Research Board, 53. , Washington DC, TCRP Synthesis; Quadrifoglio, L., Hall, R.W., Dessouky, M.M., Performance and design of mobility allowance shuttle transit services: Bounds on the maximum longitudinal velocity (2006) Transportation Science, 40 (3), pp. 351-363; Quadrifoglio, L., Dessouky, M., Palmer, K., An insertion heuristic for scheduling mobility allowance shuttle transit mast services (2007) Journal of Scheduling, 10, pp. 25-40; Quadrifoglio, L., Dessouky, M.M., Sensitivity analyses over the service area for mobility allowance shuttle transit mast services (2008) Computer-aided Systems in Public Transport Ser.

If a customer is absent when the vehicle serves the pickup location, the request is fulfilled by an alternative service (e.g., a taxi) whose cost is added to the total cost of the tour. In this case, the vehicle skips the corresponding delivery location, which yields a reduction in the total tour cost. The aim of the problem is to determine an a priori Hamiltonian tour minimizing the expected cost of the solution. This problem is solved by means of an integer L-shaped algorithm. Computational experiments show that the algorithm yields optimal solutions on several instances within reasonable CPU times. It is also shown that the actual cost of an optimal solution obtained with this algorithm can be significantly smaller than that of an optimal solution obtained with a deterministic formulation. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This work is focused on the simulation of events occurring in real time. That is, as requests are generated by vehicle users and the planning moves forward in time events may occur that affect them so that there should be a re-planning procedure. Among the diverse considered events can be considered: user delays and cancellations of requests, failure of vehicles in operation, among others. Under these premises is given a software architecture based on agents that is capable of supporting such events and hence perform the replanning. This is a description of the architecture, design and implementation by using intelligent agents under the PASSI methodology. © 2010 IEEE.","Agent Architecture; DARPTW; Dial-a-ride; Scheduling","Agent architectures; DARPTW; Dial-a-Ride; Optimization problems; Passenger transportation; Re-planning; Real time; Time event; User delay; Vehicle users; Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Intelligent agents; Software agents; Software architecture; User interfaces; Transportation",,,,,"Weiss, G., Multiagent Systems: A Modern Approach to Distributed Artificial Intelligence (1999) J.

In the PDPTW, a set of identical vehicles located at a central depot must be optimally routed to service a set of transportation requests subject to capacity, time window, pairing, and precedence constraints. In this paper, we present a new exact algorithm for the PDPTW based on a set-partitioning-like integer formulation, and we describe a bounding procedure that finds a near-optimal dual solution of the LP-relaxation of the formulation by combining two dual ascent heuristics and a cut-and-column generation procedure. The final dual solution is used to generate a reduced problem containing only the routes whose reduced costs are smaller than the gap between a known upper bound and the lower bound achieved. If the resulting problem has moderate size, it is solved by an integer programming solver; otherwise, a branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm is used to close the integrality gap. Extensive computational results over the main instances from the literature show the effectiveness of the proposed exact method. © 2011 INFORMS.","Column generation; Dual ascent; Pickup and delivery; Set partitioning","Bounding procedures; Branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm; Column generation; Computational results; Dual ascent; Dual solutions; Exact algorithms; Exact methods; Integrality gaps; Lower bounds; LP-relaxation; Pickup and delivery; Pickup and delivery problem with time windows; Precedence constraints; Reduced cost; Set partitioning; Time windows; Upper Bound; Vehicle routing problem with time windows; Algorithms; Integer programming; Pickups; Vehicle routing",,,,,"Baldacci, R., Christofides, N., Mingozzi, A., An exact algorithm for the vehicle routing problem based on the set partitioning formulation with additional cuts (2008) Math.

An important subproblem arising in dynamic dial-a-ride services can be identified as the single-vehicle DARP, in which the goal is to determine the optimal route for a single vehicle with respect to a generalized objective function. The main result of this work is an adaptive insertion algorithm capable of producing optimal solutions for a time constrained version of this problem, which was first studied by Psaraftis in the early 1980s. The complexity of the algorithm is analyzed and evaluated by means of computational experiments, implying that a significant advantage of the proposed method can be identified as the possibility of controlling computational work smoothly, making the algorithm applicable to any problem size. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Given the fact that people are subject to transportation, constraints related to quality of service are usually present, such as time windows and maximum user ride time limits. In many real world applications, different types of users exist. In the field of patient and disabled people transportation, up to four different transportation modes can be distinguished. In this article we consider staff seats, patient seats, stretchers and wheelchair places. Furthermore, most companies involved in the transportation of the disabled or ill dispose of different types of vehicles. We introduce both aspects into state-of-the-art formulations and branch-and-cut algorithms for the standard dial-a-ride problem. Also a recent metaheuristic method is adapted to this new problem. In addition, a further service quality related issue is analyzed: vehicle waiting time with passengers aboard. Instances with up to 40 requests are solved to optimality. High quality solutions are obtained with the heuristic method. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Branch-and-cut; Dial-a-ride; Heterogeneous fleet; Heterogeneous passengers; Variable neighborhood search","Integer programming; Optimization; Quality of service; Transportation; Vehicles; Branch and cut; Dial-a-Ride; Heterogeneous fleet; Heterogeneous passengers; Variable neighborhood search; Heuristic methods; algorithm; heuristics; modeling; neighborhood; research; transportation mode; travel behavior; location decision; road transport; transportation planning",,,,,"Ascheuer, N., Fischetti, M., Grötschel, M., A polyhedral study of the asymmetric traveling salesman problem with time windows (2000) Networks, 36, pp. 69-79; Balas, E., Fischetti, M., Pulleyblank, W.R., The precedence-constraint asymmetric traveling salesman polytope (1995) Math.

In this paper we develop the first exact algorithm which is able to either efficiently prove the infeasibility or to provide a feasible solution. Such an algorithm could be used in a dynamic setting for determining whether it is possible or not to accept an incoming request. The algorithm includes solution space reduction procedures, and filtering algorithms for some DARP relaxations. Computational results show that the filtering algorithms are effective and that the resulting algorithm is advantageous on the more constrained instances. © 2011 INFORMS.","Algorithms; Constraint programming; Dial-A-Ride problem; Dynamic programming; Partial routes; Scheduling","Algorithms; Computer programming; Constraint theory; Fleet operations; Scheduling; Signal filtering and prediction; Computational results; Constraint programming; Dial-a-ride problem; Dynamic settings; Feasible solution; Filtering algorithm; Fleet of vehicles; Partial routes; Dynamic programming",,,,,"Beaudry, A., Laporte, G., Melo, T., Nickel, S., Dynamic transportation of patients in hospitals (2010) OR Spectrum, 32, pp. 77-107; Beldiceanu, N., Carlsson, M., Rampon, J.-X., (2005) Global Constraint Catalog, , http://www.emn.fr/x-info/sdemasse/gccat, Research Report T2005: 08, Swedish Institute of Computer Science.

Due to their efficient and proven performance, Market-based task allocation approaches have grown in popularity for many such multi-agent domains. In addition, market-based approaches are very well suited to dynamic domains such as emergency response, in which the set of the tasks or the environment changes in real time. However, market-based approaches are not guaranteed to produce optimal solutions and researchers have investigated many techniques for improving their performance in different scenarios. Since many application domains have a significant static component coupled with dynamic elements, we explore the option of enhancing team performance in these domains by seeding market-based task allocation with optimal schedules pre-computed for the static tasks. We compare the performance of the TraderBots market-based algorithm with and without the seeded optimal schedules in simulation and on a team of robots. Our results demonstrate that seeding market-based allocation with optimal schedules can improve team performance, particularly when the proportion of static tasks is high. © 2010 IOS Press.","Market-based allocation; Optimal planning; Task allocation","Agent teams; Dynamic domains; Dynamic elements; Emergency response; Environment change; Market-based allocations; Market-based approach; Optimal planning; Optimal schedule; Optimal solutions; Performance efficiency; Real time; Task allocation; Team performance; Intelligent agents; Optimization; Commerce",,,,,"Barnhart, C., Johnson, E.L., Nemhauser, G.L., Savelsbergh, M.W.P., Vance, P.H., Branch-andprice: Column generation for solving huge integer programs (1998) Operations Research, 46, pp. 316-329; Cordeau, J.-F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54 (3), pp. 573-586; Desaulniers, G., Desrosiers, J., Erdmann, A., Solomon, M.M., Soumis, F., VRP with pickup and delivery (2001) The Vehicle Routing Problem, pp. 225-242. , P.

In many diverse scientific fields, the lack of availability, high cost or inconvenience of the collection of real-world data motivates the generation of synthetic data. In many experiments, the method chosen to generate synthetic data can significantly affect the results of an experiment. Unfortunately, the scientific literature does not contain general protocols for how synthetic data should be generated. The purpose of this chapter is to rectify that deficiency. The protocol we propose is based on several generation principles. These principles motivate and organize the data generation process. The principles are operationalized by generation properties. Then, together with information about the features of the application and of the experiment, the properties are used to construct a data generation scheme. Finally, we suggest procedures for validating the synthetic data generated. The usefulness of our protocol is illustrated by a discussion of numerous applications of data generation from the optimization literature. This discussion identifies examples of both good and bad data generation practice as it relates to our protocol. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,,,,,"Aksoy, H., Bayazit, M., A model for daily flows of intermittent streams (2000) Hydrological Processes, 14, pp. 1725-1744; Amini, M.M., Racer, M., A rigorous computational comparison of alternative solution methods for the generalized assignment problem (1994) Management Science, 40, pp. 868-890; Andersen, E.D., Ye, Y., A computational study of the homogeneous algorithm for large-scale convex optimization (1998) Computational Optimization and Applications, 10, pp. 243-269; Angel, E., Zissimopoulos, V., Autocorrelation coefficient for the graph bipartitioning problem (1998) Theoretical Computer Science, 191, pp. 229-243; Angel, E., Zissimopoulos, V., On the classification of NP-complete problems in terms of their correlation coefficient (2000) Discrete Applied Mathematics, 99, pp. 261-277; Arthur, J.L., Frendewey, J.O., Generating travelling-salesman problems with known optimal tours (1988) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 39, pp. 153-159; Atamturk, A., Strong formulations of robust mixed 0-1 programming (2007) Mathematical Programming, 108, pp. 235-250; Bailey, D.D., Dalmau, V., Kolaitis, P.G., Phase transitions of PP-complete satisfiability problems (2007) Discrete Applied Mathematics, 155, pp. 1627-1639; Balas, E., Martin, C.H., Pivot and complement - A heuristic for 0-1 programming (1980) Management Science, 26, pp. 86-96; Balas, E., Zemel, E., An algorithm for large zero-one knapsack problems (1980) Operations Research, 28, pp. 1130-1154; Bauer, H.U., Herrmann, M., Villmann, T., Neural maps and topographic vector quantization (1999) Neural Networks, 12, pp. 659-676; Bayraksan, G., Morton, D., Assessing solution quality in stochastic programs (2007) Mathematical Programming, 108, pp. 495-514; Bertsimas, D., Natarajan, K., Teo, C.P., Persistence in discrete optimization under demand uncertainty (2006) Mathematical Programming, 108, pp. 251-274; Beyer, K., Goldstein, J., Ramakrishnan, R., When is nearest neighbour meaningful?

In currently implemented systems in the Netherlands, however, we observe a decrease in the quality of service (QoS), expressed in longer travel times for the customers. Currently, generally one transport company is responsible for transporting all customers located in a specified geographic zone. In general it is known that when multiple companies compete on costs, the price for customers decreases. In this paper, we investigate whether a similar result can be achieved when competing on quality instead. To arrive at some first conclusions, we set up a multiagent environment to simulate the assignment of rides to companies through an auction on QoS, and the insertion of allocated rides in the companies' schedules using online optimization. Our results reveal that this set-up improves the quality of the service offered to the customers at moderately higher costs. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","auction; Dial-a-ride; multi-company; quality of service","auction; Dial-a-Ride; Geographic zones; High quality; Multi-agent environment; multi-company; Netherlands; Online optimization; Transport companies; Travel time; Geographic zones; High quality; Multi-agent environment; Netherlands; Online optimization; Transport companies; Customer satisfaction; Industry; Quality control; Quality of service; Sales; Technical presentations; Telecommunication services; Costs; Multi agent systems; Sales; Travel time; Multi agent systems; Quality of service",,,,,"Cordeau, J.F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54, pp. 573-586; Karp, R.M., Reducibility among combinatorial problems (1972) Complexity of Computer Computations, pp. 85-103. , Miller, R.

Several attributes can be defined for one arc (travel time, travel cost, etc.), but the shortest route modeled by this arc is computed according to a single criterion, generally travel time. Consequently, some alternative routes proposing a different compromise between the attributes of the arcs are discarded from the solution space. We propose to consider these alternative routes and to evaluate their impact on solution algorithms and solution values through a multigraph representation of the road network. We point out the difficulties brought by this representation for general vehicle routing problems, which drives us to introduce the so-called fixed sequence arc selection problem (FSASP). We propose a dynamic programming solution method for this problem. In the context of an on-demand transportation (ODT) problem, we then propose a simple insertion algorithm based on iterative FSASP solving and a branch-and-price exact method. Computational experiments on modified instances from the literature and on realistic data issued from an ODT system in the French Doubs Central area underline the cost savings brought by the proposed methods using the multigraph model. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The problem variant considered in this paper aims at minimizing total routing costs while respecting maximum route duration limits, time windows, and maximum user ride time limits. We propose a competitive variable neighborhood search-based heuristic, using three classes of neighborhoods. The first neighborhood class uses simple swap operations tailored to the dial-a-ride problem; the second neighborhood class is based on the ejection chain idea; and the third neighborhood class exploits the existence of arcs where the vehicle load is zero, giving rise to natural sequences of requests.

Many do not operate vehicles themselves; instead, they contract out the provision of services. Contractors are paid for each hour of service. They are responsible for hiring crew, forming routes, dispatching, and operating and maintaining agency-owned vehicles. In the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, Metro Mobility, the agency responsible for providing paratransit services, requires contractors to use agency-approved software for booking trips dynamically and sets parameters that guide contractors' practices. Customer trips booked in this fashion may not utilize capacity in the most efficient manner. Therefore, beginning with the daily trip schedules generated by the software, this paper proposes two approaches for improving the efficiency of paratransit operations and estimates the benefit of using these approaches via experiments that utilize Metro Mobility data. The first approach re-optimizes routes developed at the end of each day. The second approach evaluates the benefit to state agencies of selectively using non-dedicated service providers such as taxis. Both approaches are tested on actual data obtained from Metro Mobility. The study shows that a conservative estimate of savings from re-optimization would be approximately 5% of Metro Mobility's operating costs. Savings from the use of taxis are smaller and in the range of hundreds of dollars per day. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we add the flexibility of providing the option for passengers to transfer from one vehicle to another at specific locations. As part of the mathematical formulation, we include transfer nodes where vehicles may interact interchanging passengers. Additional variables to keep track of customers along their route are considered. The formulation has been proven to work correctly, and by means of a simple example instance, we conclude that there exist some configurations in which a scheme allowing transfers results in better quality optimal solutions. Finally, a solution method based on Benders decomposition is addressed. We compare the computational effort of this application with a straight branch and bound strategy; we also provide insights to develop more efficient set partitioning formulations and associated algorithms for solving real-size problems. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The problem consists of determining a minimum cost tour such that each pickup vertex is visited before its corresponding delivery vertex. In this paper, the TSPPD is modeled as an integer linear program and its polyhedral structure is analyzed. In particular, the dimension of the TSPPD polytope is determined and several valid inequalities, some of which are facet defining, are introduced. Separation procedures and a branch-and-cut algorithm are developed.

The problem consists of determining a shortest Hamiltonian cycle through all locations while ensuring that the pickup of each request is performed before the corresponding delivery. This article addresses a variant of the TSPPD in which pickups and deliveries must be performed according to a Last-In First-Out (LIFO) policy. We propose three mathematical formulations for this problem and several families of valid inequalities which are used within a branch-and-cut algorithm.

The aim is to provide an efficient and timely transport service to patients between several locations in a hospital campus. Transportation requests arrive in a dynamic fashion and the solution methodology must therefore be capable of quickly inserting new requests in the current vehicle routes. Contrary to standard dial-a-ride problems, the problem under study includes several complicating constraints which are specific to a hospital context. The study provides a detailed description of the problem and proposes a two-phase heuristic procedure capable of handling its many features. In the first phase a simple insertion scheme is used to generate a feasible solution, which is improved in the second phase with a tabu search algorithm. The heuristic procedure was extensively tested on real data provided by a German hospital. Results show that the algorithm is capable of handling the dynamic aspect of the problem and of providing high-quality solutions. In particular, it succeeded in reducing waiting times for patients while using fewer vehicles. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Dial-a-ride; Dynamic mode; In-house hospital transportation; Tabu search",,,,,,"Aldaihani, M., Dessouky, M., Hybrid scheduling methods for paratransit operations (2003) Comput Ind Eng, 45, pp. 75-96; Attanasio, A., Cordeau, J.-F., Ghiani, G., Laporte, G., Parallel tabu search heuristics for the dynamic multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2004) Parallel Comput, 30, pp. 377-387; Banerjea-brodeur, M., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Lasry, A., Scheduling linen deliveries in a large hospital (1998) J Oper Res Soc, 49, pp. 777-780; Baugh, J., Krishna, G., Kakivaya, R., Stone, J., Intractability of the dial-a-ride problem and a multiobjective solution using simulated annealing (1998) Eng Optim, 30, pp. 91-123; Bent, R., van hentenryck, P., A two-stage hybrid algorithm for pickup and delivery vehicle routing problems with time windows (2006) Comput Oper Res, 33, pp. 875-893; Bodin, L.D., Sexton, T., The multi-vehicle subscriber dial-a-ride problem (1986) TIMS Stud Manage Sci, 22, pp. 73-86; Borndörfer, R., Grötschel, M., Klostermeister, F., Küttner, C., (1997) Telebus Berlin: Vehicle Scheduling in a Dial-a-Ride System, , http://www.zib.de/PaperWeb/abstracts/SC-97-23, Technical Report SC 97-23, Konrad-Zuse-Zentrum für Informationstechnik Berlin, Germany.

All delivery customers must be visited by the vehicle, while a collection customer is visited only if the capacity of the vehicle is large enough to fit the collected load and the visit reduces collection costs that would be otherwise incurred. The goal is to minimize the transportation and collection costs. A model is proposed and solved utilizing a branch-and-cut method. Efficient new cuts are proposed. Computational experience is offered on two sets of test problems. It is proved possible to solve instances that previous methods were unable to solve.

Itprovides a visualized analyzing and assistant tool for supporting schedulers inreal-time decision making process. In this paper, GIS-based isochrones havebeen applied to an urban distribution decision problem. We study the real-timevehicle rerouting problem that handles disruptions due to an immediate requestfrom a new customer. In such problems, one or more vehicles, which areperforming the original plan, need to be rerouted in real time with theobjective to minimize the negative effects brought out by the disruption. Amulti-objective model was built for the rerouting problem based on the theory ofdisruption management. The isochrones are applied to reducing the problem'sscale in the process of selecting feasible vehicles by using travel timescalculated with real-world road data instead of fixed travel times. A case wasinvestigated to demonstrate the efficiency of this approach to supporting thereal-time decision making process.

Besides the minimum cost objective a client centered objective has been defined. Phase one consists of an iterated variable neighborhood search-based heuristic, generating approximate weighted sum solutions; phase two is a path relinking module, computing additional efficient solutions. Results for two sets of benchmark instances are reported. For the smaller instances, exact efficient sets are generated by means of the ε-constraint method. Comparison shows that the proposed two-phase method is able to generate high-quality approximations of the true Pareto frontier. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Bi-objective optimization; Dial-a-ride problem; Path relinking; Variable neighborhood search","Bi-objective optimization; Constraint methods; Dial-a-ride problem; Efficient sets; High quality; Minimum cost; Multi objective; Pareto frontiers; Path relinking; Phase solutions; Two phase method; Variable neighborhood search; Weighted Sum; Heuristic methods",,,,,"Aiex, R.M., Binato, S., Resende, M.G.C., Parallel GRASP with path relinking for job shop scheduling (2003) Parallel Comput, 29, pp. 393-430; Aiex, R.M., Resende, M.G.C., Pardalos, P.M., Toraldo, G., GRASP with path relinking for the three-index assignment problem (2005) INFORMS J Comput, 17, pp. 224-247; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Gribkovskaia, I., Laporte, G., Static pickup and delivery problems: A classification scheme and survey (2007) TOP, 15, pp. 1-31; Bräysy, O., A reactive variable neighborhood search for the vehicle-routing problem with time windows (2003) INFORMS J Comput, 15, pp. 347-368; Cordeau, J.-F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Oper Res, 54, pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transport Res B-Meth, 37, pp. 579-594; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem: Models and algorithms (2007) Ann Oper Res, 153, pp. 29-46; Cullen, F., Jarvis, J., Ratliff, D., Set partitioning based heuristics for interactive routing (1981) Networks, 11, pp. 125-143; Czyzak, P., Jaszkiewicz, A., A multiobjective metaheuristic approach to the location of petrol stations by the capital budgeting model (1996) Control and Cybernetics, 25 (1), pp. 177-187. , Simulated Annealing Applied to Combinational Optimization; Czyzak, P., Jaszkiewicz, A., Pareto simulated annealing - A metaheuristic technique for multiple-objective combinatorial optimization (1998) J Multi-Crit Dec Anal, 7, pp. 34-47; Deb, K., Pratap, A., Agarwal, S., Meyarivan, T., A fast and elitist multi-objective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II (2002) IEEE T Evol Comput, 6, pp. 182-197; Diana, M., Dessouky, M.M., A new regret insertion heuristic for solving large-scale dial-a-ride problems with time windows (2004) Transport Res B-Meth, 38, pp. 539-557; Doerner, K.F., Gutjahr, W.J., Hartl, R.F., Strauss, C., Stummer, C., Pareto ant colony optimization: A metaheuristic approach to multi-objective portfolio selection (2004) Ann Oper Res, 131, pp. 79-99; Dumas, Y., Desrosiers, J., Soumis, F., Large scale multi- vehicle dial-a-ride problems (1989) Technical Report G-89-130, , HEC, Montréal, Canada; Ehrgott, M., Gandibleux, X., Approximative solution methods for multi-objective combinatorial optimization (2004) TOP, 12, pp. 1-89; Ehrgott, M., Tenfelde-Podehl, D., Computation of ideal and Nadir values and implications for their use in MCDM methods (2003) Eur J Oper Res, 151, pp. 119-139; Gandibleux, X., Mezdaoui, N., Fréville, A., A tabu search procedure to solve multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (1997) Lecture Notes in Economics and Mathematical Systems, MOPGP 1996, 455, pp. 291-300. , R.

This problem is to schedule dial-a-ride requests, where some part of each journey may be carried out by a fixed route service. The IDARP is a generalization of the Dial-a-Ride Problem. An arc-based formulation is proposed, and it is shown how the model can be made easier to solve by arc elimination, variable substitution and the introduction of subtour elimination constraints. Small instances of the IDARP can be solved using an exact solution method, and one such instance is studied. We also describe how input and output data can be created and visualized in a geographic information system. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",,"Dial-a-Ride; Dial-a-ride problem; Exact solution; Input and outputs; Variable substitution; Geographic information systems",,,,,"Aldaihani, M., Dessouky, M., Hybrid scheduling methods for paratransit operations (2003) Comput Ind Eng, 45, pp. 75-96; Attanasio, A., Cordeau, J., Ghiani, G., Laporte, G., Parallel tabu search heuristics for the dynamic multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2004) Parallel Comput, 30, pp. 377-387; Baugh, J., Kakivaya, G., Stone, J., Intractability of the dial-a-ride problem and a multiobjective solution using simulated annealing (1998) Eng Optim, 30, pp. 91-123; Bergvinsdottir, K., Larsen, J., Jorgensen, R., (2004) Solving the dial-a-ride problem using genetic algorithms, , Technical Report 2004-20, Informatics and Mathematical Modelling, Technical University of Denmark, Denmark; Börjesson, M., (2001) Erfarenheter av samordning av färdtjänst och sjukresor i Dalsland, , Vinnova Rapport 2001: 27; Borndörfer, R., Grötschel, M., Klostermeier, F., Küttner, C., Telebus Berlin: Vehicle scheduling in a dial-a-ride system (1997), Technical Report SC 97-23, Konrad-Zuse-Zentrum für Informationstechnik, Berlin; Chan, S., (2004) Metaheuristics for solving the dial-a-ride problem, , PhD Thesis, North Carolina State University, USA; Cordeau, J., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Oper Res, 54, pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transp Res Part B, 37, pp. 579-594; Diana, M., Dessouky, M., A new regret insertion heuristic for solving large-scale dial-a-ride problems with time windows (2004) Transp Res Part B, 38, pp. 539-557; Hickman, M., Blume, K., (2001) An investigation of integrated transit service, , Research Report SWUTC/01/472840-00023-1, Texas Transportation Institute, USA; Horn, M., Procedures for planning multi-leg journeys with fixed-route and demand-responsive passenger transport services (2004) Transp Res Part C, 12, pp. 33-55; Ioachim, I., Desrosiers, J., Dumas, Y., Solomon, M., Villeneuve, D., A request clustering algorithm for door-to-door handicapped transportation (1995) Transp Sci, 29, pp. 63-78; Jaw, J., Odoni, A., Psaraftis, H., Wilson, N., A heuristic algorithm for the multi-vehicle advance request dial-a-ride problem with time windows (1986) Transp Res Part B, 20, pp. 243-257; Liaw, C., White, C., Bander, J., A decision support system for the bimodal dial-a-ride problem (1996) IEEE Trans Syst Man Cybern Part A, 26, pp. 552-565; Madsen, O., Ravn, H., Rygaard, J.M., A heuristic algorithm for a dial-a-ride problem with time windows, multiple capacities, and multiple objectives (1995) Ann Oper Res, 60, pp. 193-208; Parragh, S., Doerner, K., Hartl, R., A survey on pickup and delivery problems: Part II: Transportation between pickup and delivery locations (2008) J Betriebswirtsch, 58, pp. 81-117; Psaraftis, H., A dynamic programming solution to the single vehicle many-to-many immediate request dial-a-ride problem (1980) Transp Sci, 14, pp. 130-154; Psaraftis, H., An exact algorithm for the single vehicle many-to-many dial-a-ride problem with time windows (1983) Transp Sci, 17, pp. 351-357; Ropke, S., Cordeau, J., Laporte, G., Models and branch-and-cut algorithms for pickup and delivery problems with time windows (2007) Networks, 49, pp. 258-272; Toth, P., Vigo, D., Heuristic algorithms for the handicapped persons transportation problem (1997) Transp Sci, 31, pp. 60-71; Uchimura, K., Takahashi, H., Saitoh, T., Demand responsive services in hierarchical public transportation system (2002) IEEE Trans Veh Technol, 51, pp. 760-766; Wilson, N., Sussman, J., Wang, H., Higonnet, B., (1971) Scheduling algorithms for dial-a-ride systems, , Technical Report USL-TR-71-13, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA; Wilson, N., Weissberg, R., Hauser, J., (1976) Advanced dial-a-ride algorithms research project: Final report, , Technical Report 76-20, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA","Häll, C.

Depending on the hospital layout, transportation between nursing wards and service units is either provided by ambulances or by trained personnel who accompany patients on foot. In many large German hospitals, the patient transport service is poorly managed and lacks work-flow coordination. This contributes to higher hospital costs (e.g., because a patient is not delivered to the operating room on time) and to patient inconvenience (e.g., because of long waiting times). We designed a computer-based planning system, Opti-TRANS©, that supports all phases of the transportation flow, including travel booking, dispatching transport requests, and monitoring and reporting trips in real time. The methodology, which we developed to solve the underlying optimization problem-a dynamic dial-a-ride problem with hospital-specific constraints, draws on fast heuristic methods to ensure the efficient and timely provision of transports. We illustrate the strong impact of Opti-TRANS on the daily performance of the patient transportation service of a large German hospital. The major benefits of Opti-TRANS include streamlined transportation processes and work flow, significant savings, and improved patient satisfaction. Moreover, it has contributed to increased awareness among hospital staff of the importance of implementing efficient logistics practices. © 2009 INFORMS.","Algorithms; Health care; Heuristic; Integer; Programming; Scheduling vehicles; Transportation; Vehicle routing",,,,,,"Aldaihani, M., Dessouky, M., Hybrid scheduling methods for paratransit operations (2003) Comput.

In order to study quality in such contexts, the paper first provides several definitions of quality in the service sector. Then, some models based on the definitions of quality in marketing will be quickly surveyed, and various measurement scales will be presented. After a brief review of the tools and practices used in the service sector to improve quality, the notion of quality in dial-a-ride services is discussed more in depth. In particular, the dimensions and attributes of various scales of measurement used by researchers in dial-a-ride studies are reviewed. Finally, the impact on quality of various elements, like the size and type of organization and the operational rules used, are discussed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We refer to the Gioia Tauro container terminal which recently has reached a high stage of growth, becoming one of the most important transhipment ports in the Mediterranean Sea. In particular, we focus on quay-side problems (berth allocation and quay crane scheduling), yard-side problems (tactical and operational yard management), vehicle routing problems and human resources management problems. The common final aim, in facing the above problems, is to improve the efficiency, and thus the competitiveness of the container terminal. © 2009 Palgrave Macmillan.","Berth; Quay crane; Straddle carrier; Transhipment container terminal; Yard",,,,,,"Benedetto, C., Greco, S., Iero, D., Labate, D., Perri, V., Rtg/Shuttle Carrier Mixed to a Traditional Straddle Carrier as a New Operating Concept to Handle Containers in a Transhipment Container Terminal (2007) Proceedings of the XXXVIII Annual Conference of the Italian Operations Research Society; 5-8, p. 101. , September, Genova, Italy, p; Bose, J., Reiners, T., Steenken, D., Voss, S., Vehicle Dispatching at Seaport Container Terminals Using Evolutionary Algorithms (2000) IEEE-Proceedings of the 33rd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, pp. 1-10. , R.H.

The problem complexity (NP-Hard) forces the use of heuristics on its resolution. In this context, the application of Genetic Algorithms (GA) on DARPTW was not largely considered, with the exception of a few researches. In this work, under a restrictive scenario, a GA model for the problem was developed based on the adaptation of a generic GA model from literature. Our solution applies data pre-processing techniques to reduce the search space to points that are feasible regarding time windows constraints.

The timely arrivals of these vehicles help ensure efficient use of airport resources. This research investigates algorithms for scheduling airport service vehicles. A mixed integer linear program is proposed, minimizing service provider fuel costs and air carrier delays. The formulation of the integer programming problem is modified to aid solution search strategies. A genetic algorithm heuristic borrowed from aircraft arrival scheduling is introduced for finding approximate solutions relatively quickly, in addition to an exact solution method making use of branch and bound techniques specially designed for this problem. The various algorithms are tested using simulations of service provider dispatch problems at Hamburg and Dallas-Fort Worth Airports. Results show that plan based service vehicle scheduling reduces both delay and fuel costs over passive strategies, often 20% or more. The genetic algorithm based heuristic also reduced delay and fuel costs while incurring computational burdens significantly below those of the optimal search strategy.","Airport surface; Decision support tools; Scheduling; Service vehicles; Vehicle routing","Advanced traffic management systems; Air traffic control; Airports; Algorithms; Amphibious vehicles; Branch and bound method; Cost reduction; Costs; Decision support systems; Fighter aircraft; Fuels; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Integer programming; Research and development management; Scheduling algorithms; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Airport surfaces; Approximate solution; Branch and bound techniques; Computational burden; Decision support tools; Integer programming problems; Mixed integer linear program; Optimal search strategy; Scheduling",,,,,"Idris, H., Delcaire, B., Anagnostakis, I., Hall, W.D., Hansman, R.J., Feron, E., Odoni, A., Observations of departure processes at Logan Airport to support the development of departure planning tools (1998) 2nd USA/Europe Air Traffic Management R&D Seminar, , Orlando, USA; Anagnostakis, I., Idris, H.R., Clarke, J.-P., Feron, E., Hansman, R.J., Odoni, A., Hall, W.D., A conceptual design of a departure planner decision aid (2000) 3rd USA/Europe Air Traffic Management R&D Seminar, , Naples, Italy; Carr, F., Theis, G., Clarke, J.-P., Feron, E., Evaluation of improved pushback forecasts derived from airline ground operations data (2005) Journal of Aerospace Computing, Information, and Communication, 12, pp. 25-43; Treude, R., Optimizing performance by monitoring the turnaround process (2005) 5th R& D Symposium, , Braunschweig, Germany; Jaw, J., Odoni, A., Psaraftis, H.N., Wilson, N.H.M., A heuristic algorithm for the multi-vehicle advance request dial-a-ride problem with time windows (1986) Transportation Research Part B, 20, pp. 243-257; Bodin, L.D., Sexton, T., The multi-vehicle subscriber dial-a-ride problem (1986) TIMS Studies in Management Science, 26, pp. 73-86; Cordreau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B, 37, pp. 579-594; Cordreau, J.-F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54, pp. 573-586; Feuerstein, E., Stougie, L., On-line single-server dial-a-ride problems (2001) Theoretical Computer Science, 268, pp. 91-105; Krumke, S.O., De Paepe, W.E., Poensgen, D., Stougie, L., News from the online traveling repairman (2003) Theoretical Computer Science, 295, pp. 279-294; Bonifaci, V., Stougie, L., Online k-server routing problems (2006) 4th Workshop on Approximation and Online Algorithms, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, , Zürich, Switzerland; Jaillet, P., Wagner, M., Online routing problems: Value of advanced information and improved competitive ratios (2006) Transportation Science, 40, pp. 200-210; Ernst, A.T., Krishnamoorthy, M., Storer, R.H., Heuristic and exact algorithms for scheduling aircraft landings (1999) Networks, 34, pp. 229-241",,,"","EUROCONTROL","8th USA/Europe Air Traffic Management Research and Development Seminar, ATM 2009","29 June 2009 through 2 July 2009",,113760,,9781510801714,,,"English","Proc.

The simulated annealing application is straightforward with three types of neighbors' moves that are randomly selected and equally distributed. The routes are clustered and scheduled in a separate way using specific heuristic methods.

It is also referred to as a dial-a-ride problem, and it can be classified as a multi-depot pickup and delivery problem with time windows and side constraints. The column generation approach constitutes one of the effective methodologies to solve this problem. However, in order to cope with the complexity of the problem, it is commonly applied in two consecutive stages: clustering and routing. First, clusters of customers are formed who will receive service together; next, vehicle routing decisions are made subject to the clustering decisions. This paper develops a nested column generation method, which integrates clustering and routing decisions, thus extending the applicability of the column generation approach in the context of the subject problem. The proposed method is implemented and applied to solve a problem faced by the transit authority of a mid size US city. A detailed account of implementation experience is provided. The computational results, based on actual data, indicate that problem instances with up to 680 requests and 48 vehicles can be solved within 2% of optimality under mild assumptions, and a 12% performance improvement over a well-established manual planning system can be achieved.","Column generation; Dial-a-ride; Mathematical decomposition; Paratransit; Pickup and delivery problem with time windows; Vehicle routing","Fleet operations; Linear programming; Pickups; Scheduling; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Column generation; Dial-a-Ride; Mathematical decomposition; Paratransit; Pickup and delivery problem with time windows; Problem solving; cluster analysis; decomposition analysis; methodology; planning system; transportation system",,,,,"Astfalk, G., Lustig, I., Marsten, R., Shanno, D., The interior-point method for linear programming (1992) IEEE Software, 9 (4), pp. 61-68; Barnhart, C., Johnson, E.L., Nemhauser, G.L., Savelsbergh, M.W.P., Vance, P.H., Branch-and-price: column generation for solving huge integer programs (1998) Operations Research, 46 (3), pp. 316-329; Bazaraa, M.S., Jarvis, J.J., Sherali, H.D., (2004) Linear Programming and Network Flows. third ed., , John Wiley & Sons, Hoboken, New Jersey; Bodin, L., Golden, B., Assad, A., Ball, M., The routing and scheduling of vehicles and crews - the state of the art (1983) Computers and Operations Research, 10 (2), pp. 62-212; Borndorfer, R., Grotschel, M., Klostermeier, F., Kuttner, C., Telebus Berlin: vehicle scheduling in a dial-a-ride system (1999) Computer-Aided Transit Scheduling.

This paper introduces a new branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm in which lower bounds are computed by solving through column generation the linear programming relaxation of a set partitioning formulation. Two pricing subproblems are considered in the column generation algorithm: an elementary and nonelementary shortest path problem. Valid inequalities are added dynamically to strengthen the relaxations. Some of the previously proposed inequalities for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows are also shown to be implied by the set partitioning formulation. Computational experiments indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms a recent branch-and-cut algorithm. © 2009 INFORMS.","Branch and cut; Branch and price; Column generation; Pickup and delivery; Valid inequalities","Costs; Graph theory; Linear programming; Pickups; Transportation routes; Branch and cut; Branch and price; Column generation; Pickup and delivery; Valid inequality; Integer programming",,,,,"Balas, E., Fischetti, M., Pulleyblank, W.R., The precedenceconstrained asymmetric traveling salesman polytope (1995) Math.

The student is force transferred to an alternate district school with available capacity. Once forced transfer students arrive to their base school, they ride an additional bus to their alternate school, potentially resulting in lost educational time. We analyze a circuit routing strategy, in which each bus travels a cycle or loop pattern, and each school can be visited at most one time on any circuit. We propose optimization-based solution approaches, which assign schools to circuit routes in order to minimize competing performance measures.","Mathematical models; Operations research; Optimization; Transportation; Vehicle routing","Available capacities; Performance measures; Routing strategies; Solution approaches; Transfer students; Computer simulation; Mathematical models; Operations research; Optimization; Students; Vehicle routing; Electric network analysis",,,,,"Nagy, G., Salhi, S., Heuristic Algorithms for Single and Multiple Depot Vehicle Routing Problems with Pickups and Deliveries (2005) European Journal of Operations Research, 162, pp. 162-141; Cordeau, J.F., A Branch-and-Cut Algorithm for the Dial-a-Ride Problem (2006) Operations Research, 54 (3), pp. 573-586","Ferguson, J.

For multi-objective optimization model, most researches consider two objectives. A multi-objective mathematical model for VRP is proposed, which considers the number of vehicles used, the length of route and the time arrived at each client. Genetic algorithm is one of the most widely used algorithms to solve VRP. As a type of genetic algorithm (GA), non-dominated sorting in genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) also suffers from premature convergence and enclosure competition. In order to avoid these kinds of shortage, a greedy NSGA-II (GNSGA-II) is proposed for VRP problem. Greedy algorithm is implemented in generating the initial population, cross-over and mutation. All these procedures ensure that NSGA-II is prevented from premature convergence and refine the performance of NSGA-II at each step. In the distribution problem of a distribution center in Michigan, US, the GNSGA-II is compared with NSGA-II. As a result, the GNSGA-II is the most efficient one and can get the most optimized solution to VRP problem. Also, in GNSGA-II, premature convergence is better avoided and search efficiency has been improved sharply.","Greedy non-dominated sorting in genetic algorithm-II (GNSGA-II); Multi-objective optimization; Vehicle routing problem (VRP)","Arsenic; Convergence of numerical methods; Evolutionary algorithms; Functions; Genetic algorithms; Mathematical models; Multiobjective optimization; Network routing; Optimization; Routing algorithms; Vehicles; Cross overs; Distribution centers; Distribution problems; Greedy algorithms; Greedy non-dominated sorting in genetic algorithm-II (GNSGA-II); Initial populations; Michigan , US; Nsga-ii; Number of vehicles; Optimized solutions; Premature convergences; Search efficiencies; Single objectives; Vehicle routing problem (VRP); Vehicle routing",,,,,"Han, S., Li, X., (2006) Study on the Multiobjective Optimization Methods for the Logistics Distribution Route Choice Problems, , Nanjing: Southeast University Press, Chinese source; Liu, C., Chang, T., Huang, L., Multi-objective heuristics for the vehicle routing problem (2006) International Journal of Operations Research, 3 (3), pp. 173-181; Feng, H., Liu, F., (2004) Study on Optimum Scheduling Technology in Agile Supply Chain of Manufacturing System, , Chongqing: Chongqing University Publishers, Chinese source; Ibaraki, T., Imahori, S., Kubo, M., Effective local search algorithms for routing and scheduling problems with general time-window constraints (2005) Transportation Science, 39 (1), pp. 206-232; Bodin, L.D., Twenty years of routing and scheduling (1990) Operations Research, 38 (1), pp. 571-579; Tan, K.C., Chew, Y.H., Lee, L.H., A hybrid multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for solving truck and trailer vehicle routing problems (2006) European Journal of Operational Research, 172 (1), pp. 855-885; Lin, C.K.Y., Kwok, R.C.W., Multi-objective metaheuristics for a location-routing problem with multiple use of vehicles on real data and simulated data (2006) European Journal of Operational Research, 175 (1), pp. 1833-1849; Ma, L., Algorithmic review on the travelling salesman problem (2000) Mathematics in Practice and Theory, 30 (2), pp. 156-165. , Chinese source; Cordeau, J.F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54 (1), pp. 573-586; Deb, K., (2001) Multiobjective Optimization Using Evolutionary Algorithms, , Chichester, U.K.: Wiley Press; Deb, K., A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGAII (2002) IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 6 (2), pp. 182-197; Golden, B.L., Wasil, E.A., Computed vehicle routing in the soft drink industry (1987) Operations Research, 35 (1), pp. 6-17; Lang, M., Study of the optimizing of physical distribution routing problem based on genetic algorithm (2002) China Journal of Highway and Transport, 15 (3), pp. 76-79. , Chinese source; Zheng, Q., Lu, J., (2006) Elitist Non-dominated Sorting in Genetic Algorithm and Its Application, , Hangzhou: Zhejiang University Publishers, Chinese source; Wei, Z., Xu, X., Zhan, D., A multi-objective optimization model for collaborative multi-Echelon inventory control in supply chain (2007) Acta Automatica Sinica, 33 (2), pp. 181-187. , Chinese source","Wei, T.; National CIMS Engineering Research Center, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China; email: tw314@cam.ac.uk",,,,,,,,10009345,,CJMEE,,"English","Chin J Mech Eng Engl Ed",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-58149307454

A trip between two zones is thereby assumed to take a certain time independent of where in the zones the actual pick-up and drop-off points are located. The aim of this paper is to examine the effects of using address-based shortest path calculations instead of zone-based distance estimates. A simulation environment is implemented in C#.Net, based on a standard formulation of the dynamic dial-a-ride problem, and simulations have been performed on historical data from the city of Göteborg. To evaluate the solutions, it is not adequate to evaluate only the objective function value, since a lower estimation of the distances will likely give a lower objective function value.

The importance of logistic activities performed in multi-site environments comes from the relative magnitude of the associated transportation costs and the good chance of getting large savings on such expenses. This paper first develops an exact MILP mathematical formulation for the multiple vehicle time-window-constrained pickup and delivery (MVPDPTW) problem. The approach is able to account for many-to-many transportation requests, pure pickup and delivery tasks, heterogeneous vehicles and multiple depots. Optimal solutions for a variety of benchmark problems with cluster/random distributions of pickup and delivery locations and limited sizes in terms of customer requests and vehicles have been discovered. However, the computational cost exponentially grows with the number of requests. For large-scale m-PDPTW problems, a local search improvement algorithm steadily providing a better solution through two evolutionary steps is also presented. A neighborhood structure around the starting solution is generated by first allowing multiple request exchanges among nearby trips and then permitting the reordering of nodes on every individual route. If a better set of routes is found, both steps are repeated until no improved solution is discovered. Compact MILP mathematical formulations for both sub-problems have been developed and solved through an efficient branch-and-bound algorithm. A significant number of large-scale m-PDPTW benchmark problems, some of them including up to 100 transportation requests, were successfully solved in reasonable CPU times. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The second part now considers all those problems where goods are transported between pickup and delivery locations, denoted as Vehicle Routing Problems with Pickups and Deliveries (VRPPD). These are the Pickup and Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem (PDVRP - unpaired pickup and delivery points), the classical Pickup and Delivery Problem (PDP - paired pickup and delivery points), and the Dial-A-Ride Problem (DARP - passenger transportation between paired pickup and delivery points and user inconvenience taken into consideration). Single as well as multi vehicle mathematical problem formulations for all three VRPPD types are given, and the respective exact, heuristic, and metaheuristic solution methods are discussed. © Wirtschaftsuniversität Wien, Austria 2008.","Dial-a-ride problem; Pick up and delivery problem; Pickup and delivery vehicle routing; Survey; Transportation",,,,,,"Aldaihani, M., Dessouky, M.M., Hybrid scheduling methods for paratransit operations (2003) Comput Ind Eng, 45, pp. 75-96; Alfa, A.S., Scheduling of vehicles for transportation of elderly (1986) Transport Plan Tech, 11, pp. 203-212; Ambrosini, M., Caruso, T., Foresti, S., Righini, G., (2004) A GRASP for the Pickup and Delivery Problem With Rear Loading, , Tech.

Basically, two problem classes can be distinguished. The first class, discussed in this paper, deals with the transportation of goods from the depot to linehaul customers and from backhaul customers to the depot. This class is denoted as Vehicle Routing Problems with Backhauls (VRPB). Four subtypes can be considered, namely the Vehicle Routing Problem with Clustered Backhauls (VRPCB - all linehauls before backhauls), the Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed linehauls and Backhauls (VRPMB - any sequence of linehauls and backhauls permitted), the Vehicle Routing Problem with Divisible Delivery and Pickup (VRPDDP - customers demanding delivery and pickup service can be visited twice), and the Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Delivery and Pickup (VRPSDP - customers demanding both services have to be visited exactly once). The second class, dealt with in the second part of this survey, refers to all those problems where goods are transported between pickup and delivery locations. These are the Pickup and Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem (PDVRP - unpaired pickup and delivery points), the classical Pickup and Delivery Problem (PDP - paired pickup and delivery points), and the Dial-A-Ride Problem (DARP - passenger transportation between paired pickup and delivery points and user inconvenience taken into consideration).

A successful on-demand air transportation service requires an effective scheduling system to construct minimum-cost pilot and jet itineraries for a set of accepted transportation requests. We present an integer multicommodity network flow model with side constraints for such dial-a-flight problems. We develop a variety of techniques to control the size of the network and to strengthen the quality of the linear programming relaxation, which allows the solution of small instances. In Part II, we describe how this core optimization technology is embedded in a parallel, largeneighborhood, local search scheme to produce high-quality solutions efficiently for large-scale real-life instances. © 2008 INFORMS.","Air transportation; Integer multicommodity flow; On-demand service","Fighter aircraft; Linear programming; Transportation; High-quality solutions; Linear programming relaxation; Multi-commodity flow; Multi-commodity flow models; Multi-commodity network flow models; On-demand services; Optimization technology; Transportation services; Air transportation",,,,,"Benoist, T., Bourreau, E., Caseau, Y., Rottembourg, B., Towards stochastic constraint programming: A study of online multichoice knapsack with deadlines (2001) Proc.

Each request originates at one location and is destined for one other location. These requests apply to the transportation of goods or people, in which case the problem is often called the dial-a-ride problem. In recent years, there have been several significant developments in the area of exact and heuristic algorithms for PDPs. The purpose of this chapter is to report on these developments. It contains two main sections devoted to single vehicle and multi-vehicle problems, respectively. Each section is subdivided into two parts, one on exact algorithms and one on heuristics. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008.","Branch-and-cut; Column generation; Dial-a-ride; One-to-one; Pickup and delivery; Tabu search",,,,,,"Balas, E., Fischetti, M., Pulleyblank, W.R., The precedenceconstrained asymmetric traveling salesman polytope (1995) Mathematical Programming, 68, pp. 241-265; Bent, R., Van Hentenryck, P., A two-stage hybrid algorithm for pickup and delivery vehicle routing problems with time windows (2006) Computers & Operations Research, 33, pp. 875-893; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Gribkovskaia, I., Laporte, G., Static pickup and delivery problems: A classification scheme and survey (2007) TOP, 15, pp. 1-31; Bianco, L., Mingozzi, A., Ricciardelli, S., Exact and heuristic procedures for the traveling salesman problem with precedence constraints, based on dynamic programming (1994) INFOR, 32, pp. 19-31; Bodin, L.D., Sexton, T., The multi-vehicle subscriber dial-a-ride problem (1986) TIMS Studies in Management Science, 26, pp. 73-86; Borndörfer, R., Grötschel, M., Klostermeier, F., Küttner, C., (1997) Telebus Berlin: Vehicle scheduling in a dial-a-ride system., , Technical Report SC 97-23, Konrad-Zuse-Zentrum für Informationstechnik Berlin; Brønmo, G., Christiansen, M., Fagerholt, K., Nygreen, B., A multistart local search heuristic for ship scheduling-a computational study (2007) Computers & Operations Research, 34, pp. 900-917; Carrabs, F., (2006) Heuristics and exact approaches for transportation problems with pickup and delivery., , Ph.

In addition to capacity and time window constraints, vehicle routes must also satisfy pairing and precedence constraints on pickups and deliveries. This paper introduces two new formulations for the PDPTW and the closely related dial-a-ride problem (DARP) in which a limit is imposed on the elapsed time between the pickup and the delivery of a request. Several families of valid inequalities are introduced to strengthen these two formulations. These inequalities are used within branch-and-cut algorithms which have been tested on several instance sets for both the PDPTW and the DARP. Instances with up to eight vehicles and 96 requests (194 nodes) have been solved to optimality. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Branch-and-cut; Pickup and delivery; Time windows; Valid inequalities","Constraint theory; Mathematical models; Network management; Problem solving; Time windows; Valid inequalities; Routing algorithms",,,,,"Ascheuer, N., Fischetti, M., Grötschel, M., A polyhedral study of the asymmetric traveling salesman problem with time windows (2000) Networks, 36, pp. 69-79; Ascheuer, N., Fischetti, M., Grötschel, M., Solving the asymmetric travelling salesman problem with time windows by branch-and-cut (2001) Math Program, 90, pp. 475-506; Ascheuer, N., Jünger, M., Reinelt, G., A branch & cut algorithm for the asymmetric traveling salesman problem with precedence constraints (2000) Comput Optim Appl, 17, pp. 61-84; Augerat, P., Belenguer, J.M., Benavent, E., Corberán, A., Naddef, D., Separating capacity inequalities in the CVRP using tabu search (1999) Eur J Operational Res, 106, pp. 546-557; Balas, E., Fischetti, M., Pulleyblank, W.R., The precedence-constrained asymmetric traveling salesman polytope (1995) Math Program, 68, pp. 241-265; Cordeau, J.-F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Res, 54, pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transport Res B, 37, pp. 579-594; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Potvin, J.-Y., Savelsbergh, M.W.P., Transportation on demand (2007) Transportation, Handbooks in Operations Research and Management Science, pp. 429-466. , C.

While it is not possible to change the planned route in static dtstrtbution problems, a dynamic version enables a dispatcher the integration of a new request to existing route for optimization. The mathematical models proposed in the paper are based on the Miller-Tucker-Zemlin's formulation of Traveling Salesman Problem. Because of NP hardness of the problem it is impossible for most real problems to find the optimal solution in acceptable time.
