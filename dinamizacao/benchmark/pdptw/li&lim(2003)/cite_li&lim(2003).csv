A request is composed of several pickups of different items, followed by a single delivery at the client location. We formally describe, model and solve this rich and new problem in the field of pickup and delivery vehicle routing. We solve the problem exactly via branch-and-bound and heuristically developing a hybrid adaptive large neighborhood search with improvement operations. Several new removal and insertion operators are developed to tackle the special precedence constraints, which can be used in other pickup and delivery problems. Computational results are reported on different types of instances to study the performance of the developed algorithms, highlighting the performance of our heuristic compared to the exact method, and assessing its sensibility to different parameter settings. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Multi-pickup and delivery problem; Sequential ordering problem; Vehicle routing problem","Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Optimization; Pickups; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Adaptive large neighborhood searches; Computational results; Pickup and delivery; Pickup and delivery problem with time windows; Pickup and delivery problems; Precedence constraints; Sequential ordering problems; Vehicle Routing Problems; Problem solving",,,,,"CANRIMT, NSERC, Canadian Network for Research and Innovation in Machining Technology, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","This research was partly supported by grants 2014–05764 and 2015–04893 from the Canadian Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council .

Effort has been made mainly on studying continuous problems, with interesting results and for which several proposals have appeared. An important result states that the problem does not necessarily becomes more difficult while more objectives are considered. Nevertheless, combinatorial problems have not received an appropriate attention, making this an open research area. This investigation takes this subject on by studying a many-objective combinatorial problem, particularly, the pickup and delivery problem (PDP), which is an important combinatorial optimization problem in the transportation industry and consists of finding a collection of routes with minimum cost. Traditionally, cost has been associated with the number of routes and the total travel distance, however, in many applications, some other objectives emerge, for example, travel time, workload imbalance, and uncollected profit. If we consider all these objectives equally important, PDP can be tackled as a many-objective problem. This study is concerned with the study of: (i) the performance of four representative multi-objective evolutionary algorithms on PDP varying the number of objectives, (ii) the properties of the many-objective PDP regarding scalability, i.e. the conflict between each pair of objectives and the proportion of non-dominated solutions as the number of objectives is varied, and finally (iii) the change of PDP's difficulty when the number of objectives is increased. Results show that the regarded objectives are actually in conflict and that the problem is more difficult to solve while more objectives are considered. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Combinatorial optimization; Many-objective optimization; Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms; Pickup and delivery problem","Combinatorial optimization; Evolutionary algorithms; Optimization; Pickups; Transportation routes; Travel time; Combinatorial optimization problems; Combinatorial problem; Many-objective optimizations; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; Nondominated solutions; Optimization problems; Pickup and delivery problems; Transportation industry; Problem solving",,,,,,,"Farina, M., Amato, P., On the optimal solution definition for many-criteria optimization problems (2002) Proceedings of the NAFIPS-FLINT International Conference’2002, IEEE, pp. 233-238; Hughes, E.J., Evolutionary many-objective optimisation: many once or one many?

It is an optimization vehicles routing problem which must meet requests for transport between suppliers and customers for the purpose of satisfying precedence, capacity and time constraints. This problem is a very important class of operational research, which is part of the category of NP-hard problems. Its resolution therefore requires the use of evolutionary algorithms such as Genetic Algorithms (GA) or Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). We present, in this sense, a comparative study between two approaches based respectively on the GA and the PSO for the optimization of m-MDPDPTW. We propose, in this paper, a literature review of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) and the Pick-up and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (PDPTW), present our approaches, whose objective is to give a satisfying solution to the m-MDPDPTW minimizing the total distance travelled. The performance of both approaches is evaluated using various sets instances from [10] PDPTW benchmark data problems. From our study, in the case of m-MDPDPTW problem, the proposed GA reached to better results compared with the PSO algorithm and can be considered the most appropriate model to solve our m-MDPDPTW problem. © 2018 CC BY-NC.","Genetic algorithm (GA); m-MDPDPTW; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Pick-up and delivery problem with time windows (PDPTW); Vehicle routing problem (VRP)",,,,,,,,"Ben Alaia, E., Harbaoui, D.I., Bouchriha, H., Borne, P., Genetic Algorithm for Multi-Criteria Optimization of Multi-Depots Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows and multi vehicles (2015) Acta Polytechnica Hungarica, 12 (8), pp. 155-174. , 2015; Ben Alaia, E., Harbaoui, D.I., Bouchriha, H., Borne, P., Insertion of new depot locations for the optimization of multi-vehicles Multi-Depots Pickup and Delivery Problems using Genetic Algorithm (2015) IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Systems Management, pp. 695-701. , Seville, Spain, 2015; Ben Alaia, E., Harbaoui, D.I., Bouchriha, H., Borne, P., Genetic Algorithm with Pareto Front selection for Multi-Criteria Optimization of Multi-Depots and multi-vehicle Pickup and Delivery Problems with Time Windows (2015) IEEE International Conference on Sciences and Techniques of Automatic control and computer engineering, pp. 488-493. , 21-23 December, Hammamet, Tunisie, 2014; Fatma, P.G., Fulya, A., Ismail, K., A Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization for Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Pickup and Delivery (2012) Computers and Industrial Engineering, pp. 1-6. , 2012; Harbaoui, D.I., Ben Alaia, E., Borne, P., Heuristic Approach for The Optimization of The Dynamic Multi-Vehicle Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (2015) IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Systems Management, pp. 488-493. , 21-23 October, Seville, Spain, 2015; Harbaoui, D.I., Kammarti, R., Ksouri, M., Borne, P., Multi-objective optimization for the mpdptw: Aggregation methode with use of genetic algorithm and lower bounds (2011) International Journal of Computers Communications & Control, 6 (2), pp. 246-257. , 2011; Lau, H.C.W., Chan, T.M., Tsui, W.T., Pang, W.K., Application of genetic algorithms to solve the multidepot vehicle routing problem (2010) IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering, 7 (2), pp. 383-392. , 2010; Lei, W., Fanhua, M., An Improved PSO for the Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (2008) Pacific-Asia Workshop on Computational Intelligence and Industrial Application, pp. 852-856. , 2008; Liu, R., Xi, X., Augusto, V., Rodriguez, C., Heuristic algorithms fora vehicle routing problem with simultaneous delivery and pickup andtime windows in home health care (2013) European Journal of Operational Research, 230 (3), pp. 475-486. , 2013; Li, H., Lim, A., A metaheuristic for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2001) In IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence, 13, pp. 160-167. , 2001; Marinakis, Y., Iordanidou, G.R., Marinaki, M., Particle Swarm Optimization for the Vehicle Routing Problem with Stochastic Demands (2013) Applied Soft Computing, 13 (4), pp. 1693-1704. , 2013; Marinakis, Y., Marinaki, M., Ahybrid genetic - particle swarm optimization algorithm for the vehicle routing problem (2010) Expert Systems with Applications, 37 (2), pp. 1446-1455. , 2010; Nagata, Y., Kobayashi, S., A memetic algorithm for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows using selective route exchange crossover (2011) Parallel Problem Solving from Nature, PPSN XI.

Despite the increasing competition, over 20% of all vehicles run empty on European roads. As a remedy, freight exchanges have been established to bridge such supply-demand imbalances, with the largest markets trading over 200,000 daily offers. Carriers searching for profit-maximizing freights on such markets face a Profit-Maximizing Pickup and Delivery Selection Problem (PPDSP) that has not yet been addressed in previous research. In this paper, we develop a novel graph search that branches on feasible routes for an exact solution and, based on this, we develop a randomized search heuristic for the single vehicle case, a greedy heuristic for the multi-vehicle case, and a Maximum Set Packing formulation for the case of homogeneous and heterogeneous fleets. Computational experiments show that most instances of the various setups can be solved optimally and much faster than the solution offered by the Gurobi optimizer. Both heuristics are highly efficient and the problem of fleets can be solved almost as quickly as the single vehicle case. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Branch and bound; Decision support systems; Heuristics; Logistics; Transportation","Artificial intelligence; Branch and bound method; Commerce; Decision support systems; Heuristic algorithms; Logistics; Optimization; Pickups; Profitability; Transportation; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Computational experiment; Heterogeneous fleet; Heuristics; Pickup and delivery; Randomized search; Road freight transportations; Selection problems; Supply demand imbalance; Freight transportation",,,,,,,"Arda, Y., Crama, Y., Pironet, T., A profitable pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2008) Proceedings of the 22nd annual conference of the Belgian operations research society (ORBEL 22); Baldacci, R., Bartolini, E., Mingozzi, A., An exact algorithm for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2011) Operations Research, 59 (2), pp. 414-426; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Gribkovskaia, I., Laporte, G., Static pickup and delivery problems: a classification scheme and survey (2007) TOP, 15 (1), pp. 1-31; Caplice, C., Sheffi, Y., Combinatorial auctions for truckload transportation (2006) Combinatorial auctions, pp. 539-572. , P.

Each request calls for moving products between a pick-up and a delivery location pair. A commonly adopted approach is the direct-shipping of products, without using intermediate transshipment points, or in-transit merge of shipments. Another alternative strategy that often appears in practice is to use an intermediate cross-dock facility, acting as a consolidation point for transported products. The goal of this paper is to evaluate these inherently different distribution options and to conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis regarding their cost-effectiveness. For this purpose, a local-search optimization framework has been developed. The optimization framework is tested on existing, as well as new benchmark data sets. Various computational experiments have been performed, to analyze the impact of several spatial and temporal characteristics, such as the geographic distribution of customers and suppliers, the proximity of individual pick-up and delivery pairs, the positioning of the depot, the tightness of the capacity and duration constraints, and the time required to handle and consolidate shipments at the cross-dock. The results of the computational experiments are further analyzed through a logistic regression analysis, in order to identify the characteristics that affect the relative effectiveness of the two compared strategies. In addition, a mixed model considering both direct-shipping and cross-docking is tackled by appropriately extending the proposed local-search framework. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Cross-docking; Direct-shipping; Pick-up and delivery; Tabu Search; Transportation","Cost effectiveness; Docks; Geographical distribution; Hydraulic structures; Optimization; Pickups; Regression analysis; Tabu search; Transportation; Comparative analysis; Computational experiment; Crossdocking; Different distributions; Logistic regression analysis; Optimization framework; Pickup and delivery; Temporal characteristics; Ships",,,,,"1434432, NSF, National Science Foundation; Siemens; AUEB, Athens University of Economics and Business","This work was supported by the ΙΚΥ fellowships of excellence for postgraduate studies in Greece – Siemens program, as well as by the Research Center of the Athens University of Economics and Business.

Although there exist exact algorithms for tackling this problem, they are still difficult to apply in massively large practical scheduling scenarios due to their time complexities. Hence, the approximate methods became the main stream of research in this field. In this paper, we propose an adaptive guided ejection search algorithm for solving the pickup and delivery with time windows. The pivotal part of this technique is the pre-processing step, in which the instance characteristics concerning its underlying structure are extracted in the clustering and histogram-based analyses. Then, the k-nearest neighbor algorithm is applied to classify the instance to an appropriate class. Finally, the most suitable variant of our enhanced guided ejection search algorithm is adaptively chosen for solving this instance based on the classification outcome. An extensive experimental study performed on the full Li and Lim's benchmark (encompassing 354 problem instances belonging to 6 classes) revealed that our pre-processing allows for achieving very high classification accuracy, thus for selecting the best variant of the enhanced guided ejection search. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

Vasco de Quiroga 4871, México, D.F., Mexico","The pickup and delivery problem (PDP) deals with a set of transportation requests, which specify the quantity of product that has to be picked up from an origin and delivered to a destination. PDP consists of finding a set of routes with minimum cost, such that all transportation requests are serviced by a fleet of vehicles. Usually, only two objectives have been considered to evaluate the cost of a solution. However, in many applications, some other objectives emerge, for example, the minimization of the workload imbalance, and the minimization of the uncollected profit. If we consider all these objectives equally important, PDP can be tackled as a many-objective problem. Although some studies have analyzed the scalability of continuous optimization problems, there are just a few studies using discrete optimization problems. Thus, in this paper we study the following elements: (i) the properties of the many-objective PDP regarding scalability, i.e., conflict between each pair of objectives and the proportion of non-dominated solutions as we vary the number of objectives, and finally (ii) the change of PDP's difficulty when the number of objectives is increased. Results show that most of the objectives pairs are actually in conflict, and that the problem is more difficult to solve as more objectives are considered, thus making it complicated to differentiate between equally good solutions. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Fleet operations; Pickups; Scalability; Transportation routes; Continuous optimization problems; Discrete optimization problems; Fleet of vehicles; Many-objective optimizations; Minimum cost; Nondominated solutions; Pickup and delivery problems; Optimization",,,,,,,"Laporte, G., Fifty years of vehicle routing (2009) Transport.

We are given a set of requests and a homogeneous fleet of vehicles. A set of routes of minimum total length has to be determined such that each request is transported from a loading site to the corresponding unloading site. In the 3L-PDP, each request is given as a set of 3D rectangular items (boxes) and the vehicle capacity is replaced by a 3D loading space. We investigate which constraints will ensure that no reloading effort will occur, i.e. that no box is moved after loading and before unloading. A spectrum of 3L-PDP variants is introduced with different characteristics in terms of reloading effort. We propose a hybrid algorithm for solving the 3L-PDP consisting of a routing and a packing procedure. The routing procedure modifies a well-known large neighborhood search for the 1D-PDP. A tree search heuristic is responsible for packing boxes. Computational experiments were carried out using 54 newly proposed 3L-PDP benchmark instances. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Efficient ridesharing solutions could help mitigate congestion. Some of the actions that government agencies have taken to encourage ridesharing include the availability of high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes and existing policies of discounted toll rates on HOVs. These measures encourage ridesharing by reducing costs or travel times of such trips. To study how the optimal routes change as a function of incentives for ridesharing, we modified existing pickup and delivery problems with time windows to consider changes in passenger travel time and toll cost due to vehicle load. Our computational results explore how the total route cost and time are affected by the use of HOV lanes and toll savings. In addition, our results show that it can be beneficial from a time and cost perspective to take detours to pick up additional passengers and use HOV lanes when the time saving on HOV lanes is significant. © 2016 W.

Such a definition however, loses meaning when considering purely dynamic problems where all customer requests arrive dynamically. Existing measures of dynamism are limited to either (1) measuring the proportion of online versus offline orders or (2) measuring urgency, a concept that is orthogonal to dynamism, instead. The present paper defines separate and independent formal definitions of dynamism and urgency applicable to purely dynamic problems. Using these formal definitions, instances of a dynamic logistic problem with varying levels of dynamism and urgency were constructed and several route scheduling algorithms were executed on these problem instances. Contrary to previous findings, the results indicate that dynamism is positively correlated with route quality; urgency, however, is negatively correlated with route quality. The paper contributes the theory that dynamism and urgency are two distinct concepts that deserve to be treated separately. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The first stage is the use of ant colony algorithm AS model to solve the pre-path, and the second stage is pre-path segmentation based on distribution of customer point and the constraints in the model and sub-path re-optimization which take insert heuristic based on the time window classification. Finally, simulation results are used to illustrate that the proposed algorithm can solve the vehicle path planning with time windows easily and effectively compared with other algorithms [28, 29]. Two-stage optimization algorithm proposed in this paper is a new approach to vehicle routing problem with time windows problem. © 2016 IEEE.","Ant Colony Algorithm; Insertion Heuristic Algorithm; Two-stage optimization algorithm; Vehicle routing problem with time window",,,,,,,,"Dantzig, G.B., Ramser, J.H., The truck dispatching problem (1959) Management Science, 6, p. 80; Golden, B.L., Assad, A.A., Perspective on vehicle routing: Exciting new developments (1986) Operation Research, 34 (5), pp. 803-810; Desrosier, J., Dumas, Y., Solomom, M.M., (1995) Handbooks in Operations Research and Management Science 8: Network Routing, , Amsterdam: Elsevier Science Publishers; Ho, S.C., Haugland, D., A tabu search heuristic for the vehicle routing problem with time windows and split deliveries (2004) Computers & Operations Research, 31 (12), pp. 1947-1964; Tang, J.F., Pan, Z.D., Vehicle routing problem with fuzzy time windows (2009) Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 160 (5), pp. 683-695; Dhahri, A., Zidi, K., Ghedira, K., Variable neighborhood search based set covering ilp model for the vehicle routing problem with time windows (2014) Procedia Computer Science, 29, pp. 844-854; Xu, Z.Z., Tang, J.F., Set divisions and customer point collaborations-based heuristic vehicle routing with appointment time window (2014) Control and Decision Conference (CCDC), the 26th Chinese; Dorigo, M., Maniezzo, V., Colorni, A., Ant system: Optimization by a colony of cooperating agents (1996) IEEE Trans. on System, Man, and Cybernetics, 26 (1), pp. 29-41; Li, L., Liu, S.X., Tang, J.F., Improved ant colony algorithm for solving vehicle routing problem with time windows (2010) Control and Decision, 25 (9), pp. 1379-1383; Yu, B., Jin, P.H., Yang, Z.Z., Two-stage heuristic algorithm for multi-depot verhicle routing problem with time windows (2012) Systems Engineering-Theory & Practice, 32 (8), pp. 1793-1800; Reimann, M., Dorener, K., Hartl, R.F., Insertion based ants for vehicle routing problems with back hauls and time windows (2002) Ant Algorithms, 2463, pp. 135-147. , Berlin /Heidelberg, Germany: Springer LNCS; Ioannou, G., Kritikos, M., Prastacos, G., A greedy look-ahead heuristic for the vehicle routing problem with time windows (2001) January Operation Research Society, 52, pp. 523-537; Li, H., Lim, A., A metaheuristic for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows[C] (2001) 13th IEEE Internation Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence.

We consider MRPWT from the viewpoint of robotics and incorporate practical factory application constraints in the transportation method design. The proposed MRPWT approach is a two-level hybrid planning method, consisting of an incidental delivery based single robot level planner and a simulated annealing based robot group level planner. Each robot resolves its individual transportation plan incidentally to reduce the transportation cost, whereas the group level planner utilizes predefined random actions to search the task assignment solution space and then incorporates the simulated annealing algorithm to resolve the MRPWT problem as a combinatorial optimization problem. By implementing a distributed auction mechanism, the proposed MRPWT approach can be further extended to resolve the online task allocation or reallocation problem in dynamic environments. Experiments performed on a group of mobile robots successfully demonstrate the effectiveness and the practical applicability of the proposed MRPWT approach for factory automated material and product deliveries. © 2015 IEEE.","Incidental delivery; multirobot pairwised transportation (MRPWT); simulated annealing","Combinatorial optimization; Industrial robots; Optimization; Robot programming; Robots; Simulated annealing; Transportation; Automated materials; Combinatorial optimization problems; Distributed Auctions; Dynamic environments; Simulated annealing algorithms; Transportation method; Transportation plans; Transportation problem; Materials handling",,,,,,,"Li, H., Tsukada, M., Nashashibi, F., Parent, M., Multivehicle cooperative local mapping: A methodology based on occupancy grid map merging (2014) IEEE Trans.

In this paper, we introduce a new mathematical programming formulation and present an efficient solution approach for planning the delivery services of online groceries to fulfill this diverse consumer demand without incurring additional inventory costs. We refer to our proposed model as the E-grocery Delivery Routing Problem (EDRP) as it generically represents a family of problems that an online grocery is likely to face. The EDRP is based on a distribution network where premium goods are acquired from a set of external vendors at multiple locations in the supply network and delivered to customers in a single visit. To solve this problem, we develop an improved Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) heuristic by introducing new removal, insertion, and vendor selection/allocation mechanisms. We validate the performance of the proposed ALNS heuristic through an extensive computational study using both the well-known Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows instances of Solomon and a set of new benchmark instances generated for the EDRP. The results suggest that the proposed solution methodology is effective in obtaining high quality solutions fast. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We propose an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) heuristic to address the SARP. Furthermore, we study the problem of determining the time slack in a SARP schedule. Our proposed solution approach is tested on three sets of realistic instances. The performance of our heuristic is benchmarked against a mixed integer programming (MIP) solver and the Dial-a-Ride Problem (DARP) test instances. Compared to the MIP solver, our heuristic is superior in both the solution times and the quality of the obtained solutions if the CPU time is limited.

With respect to multiple optimization objectives, PDP-TW-D is to find a set of Pareto-optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles (e.g., mobile robots, drones and autonomous heavy-haulage trucks) in order to serve given transportation requests. The proposed algorithm uses a population of individuals, each of which represents a solution candidate, and evolves them through generations to seek the Pareto-optimal solutions. In addition to the evolution-based global search process, the proposed algorithm allows individuals to improve their optimality in each generation with a local search process, which is designed based on iterative neighborhood search. Experimental results demonstrate that the integration of global and local search processes improves the optimality of individuals and expedites convergence speed. The proposed algorithm outperforms two well-known existing EMOAs, NSGA-II and MOEA/D, in relatively large-scale problems that have up to 400 pickup and delivery locations.

The customer service level associated with time window is characterized by fuzzy membership functions based on fuzzy set theory. A novel multi-objective fuzzy programming model of PDPFTW is proposed. The proposed model aims at minimizing the vehicle numbers and the overall travel costs and maximizing the total customer service level. A novel differential evolution algorithm (DE) for PDPFTW is also proposed. In DE, we first adopted the novel decimal coding to construct an initial population, and then used some improved differential evolution operators unlike existing algorithm, in mutation operation, we used an integer order criterion based on natural number coding method and introduced a penalty technical to publish the infeasible solution. In addition, in the crossover operation, we designed a self-adapting crossover probability that varied with iteration. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed DE, which saved some running time compare with GA in 100,200,400 and 1000 cases. At the same time, DE can get better solutions compare with GA in total distance of vehicles, total services level of customers and vehicle numbers. Moreover, we found that total service level would increase with wider time window. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.

The product collected from a pickup node can be delivered to any one node or multiple delivery nodes, and the demand of a delivery node can be met by the product collected from any one node or multiple pickup nodes. This periodic unpaired pickup and delivery vehicle-routing problem is a novel variant of the periodic vehicle routing problem. The objective of the problem was to design the pickup and delivery vehicle routes to meet required service levels of delivery nodes, minimizing the total transportation cost while satisfying certain operational constraints. This problem was driven by food relief operations in Sydney, Australia. The logistics aspect of the approach was to design and execute a vehicle routing problem for a food rescue and delivery network. The specifc goals were to develop an integrated linear programming model for this new variant of the periodic vehicle routing problem and to propose an integer programming-based heuristic solution approach to solve the problem introduced in the paper. The heuristic algorithm was tested with small instances created from Cordeau's benchmark instances, and the solution approach was validated against optimal solutions obtained through the exact method before implementation on a food rescue and delivery network. The heuristic approach was found to be comparable with the optimal solution and can solve the real-world scenarios with signifcantly fewer resources than are used in practice.",,"Benchmarking; Constraint satisfaction problems; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Integer programming; Linear programming; Optimal systems; Optimization; Pickups; Problem solving; Routing algorithms; Transportation routes; Vehicles; Heuristic solutions; Linear programming models; Operational constraints; Periodic vehicle routing problem; Pickup and delivery; Real-world scenario; Transportation cost; Vehicle Routing Problems; Vehicle routing",,,,,,,"Beltrami, E.J., Bodin, L.D., Networks and vehicle routing for municipal waste collection (1974) Networks, 4 (1), pp. 65-94; Francis, P., Smilowitz, K., Tzur, M., The period vehicle routing problem with service choice (2006) Transportation Science, 40 (4), pp. 439-454; Alegre, J., Laguna, M., Pacheco, J., Optimizing the periodic pick-up of raw materials for a manufacturer of auto parts (2007) European Journal of Operational Research, 179 (3), pp. 736-746; Davis, L.B., Sengul, I., Ivy, J.S., Brock, L.G., III, Miles, L., Scheduling food bank collections and deliveries to ensure food safety and improve access (2014) Socio-Economic Planning Sciences, 48 (3), pp. 175-188; Tzoreff, T.E., Granot, D., Granot, F., Sosic, G., The vehicle routing problem with pickups and deliveries on some special graphs (2002) Discrete Applied Mathematics, 116 (3), pp. 193-229; Li, H., Lim, A., A metaheuristic for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2001) Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence; Nanry, W.P., Barnes, J.W., Solving the pickup and delivery problem with time windows using reactive tabu search (2000) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 34 (2), pp. 107-121; Hernández-Pérez, H., Rodríguez-Martín, I., Salazar-González, J.-J., A hybrid grasp/vnd heuristic for the one-commodity pickupand-delivery traveling salesman problem (2009) Computers and Operations Research, 36 (5), pp. 1639-1645; Hernández-Pérez, H., Salazar-González, J.-J., A branch-and-cut algorithm for a traveling salesman problem with pickup and delivery (2004) Discrete Applied Mathematics, 145 (1), pp. 126-139; Hernández-Pérez, H., Salazar-González, J.-J., Heuristics for the one-commodity pickup-and-delivery traveling salesman problem (2004) Transportation Science, 38 (2), pp. 245-255; Foodbank, , http://www.foodbank.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Foodbank-Hunger-Report2014.pdf, End Hunger Report; Nair, D.J., Rey, D., Dixit, V., Models for food rescue and delivery: Routing and resource allocation problem (2016) Presented at 95th Annual Meeting of the Transportation Research Board, , Washington, D.C; Balcik, B., Iravani, S., Smilowitz, K., Multi-vehicle sequential resource allocation for a nonprofit distribution system (2014) IIE Transactions, 46 (12), pp. 1279-1297; Lien, R.W., Iravani, S.M.R., Smilowitz, K.R., Sequential resource allocation for nonprofit operations (2014) Operations Research, 62 (2), pp. 301-317; Campbell, A.M., Vandenbussche, D., Hermann, W., Routing for relief efforts (2008) Transportation Science, 42 (2), pp. 127-145; Russell, R., Igo, W., An assignment routing problem (1979) Networks, 9 (1), pp. 1-17; Christofides, N., Beasley, J.E., The period routing problem (1984) Networks, 14 (2), pp. 237-256; Tan, C.C.R., Beasley, J.E., A heuristic algorithm for the period vehicle routing problem (1984) Omega, 12 (5), pp. 497-504; Russell, R.A., Gribbin, D., A multiphase approach to the period routing problem (1991) Networks, 21 (7), pp. 747-765; Chao, I.-M., Golden, B.L., Wasil, E., An improved heuristic for the period vehicle routing problem (1995) Networks, 26 (1), pp. 25-44; Cordeau, J.-F., Gendreau, M., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for periodic and multi-depot vehicle routing problems (1997) Networks, 30 (2), pp. 105-119; Drummond, L.M.A., Ochi, L.S., Vianna, D.S., An asynchronous parallel metaheuristic for the period vehicle routing problem (2001) Future Generation Computer Systems, 17 (4), pp. 379-386; Hemmelmayr, V.C., Doerner, K.F., Hartl, R.F., A variable neighborhood search heuristic for periodic routing problems (2009) European Journal of Operational Research, 195 (3), pp. 791-802; Matos, A.C., Oliveira, R.C., An experimental study of the ant colony system for the period vehicle routing problem (2004) Ant Colony Optimization and Swarm Intelligence, pp. 286-293. , M.

Our proposed formulation combines the Team Orienteering Problem with the case of Pick-up and Delivery with Time Windows and Capacity Constraints. We solved this model to optimality using an exact Branch-and-Price method, which is based on previous work. To study the performance of the solution method and its refinements, we conducted extensive computational experiments. We also applied the proposed model and method to a relevant logistic system and investigated its performance under various conditions. Finally, we present a practical method to determine the most suitable fleet configuration for a pick-up and delivery system that delivers prioritized operations to a known client base. © EDP Sciences, ROADEF, SMAI 2016.","Branch and Price; Pick-up and delivery problem; Team orienteering problem; Vehicle Fleet Sizing","Integer programming; Pickups; Branch and price; Capacity constraints; Computational experiment; Pickup and delivery; Resource Constraint; Solution methods; Team orienteering problems; Vehicle fleets; Fleet operations",,,,,,,"Archetti, C., Feillet, D., Hertz, A., Speranza, M., The capacitated team orienteering, and profitable tour problems (2009) J.

As just-in-time ordering practices become more common, traditionally fixed resupply routes and schedules are increasingly unable to meet the demands of the supermarkets. Instead, we model this as a dynamic pickup and delivery problem with soft time windows (PDPSTW). We present the variable neighbourhood descent with memory (VNDM) hybrid metaheuristic (HM) and compare its performance against Q-learning (QL), binary exponential back off (BEBO) and random descent (RD) hyperheuristics on published benchmark and real-world instances of the PDPSTW. We find that VNDM consistently generates the highest quality solutions, with the fewest routes or shortest distances, amongst the methods tested. It is capable of finding the best known solutions to 55 of 176 published benchmarks as well as producing the best results on our real-world data set, supplied by Transfaction Ltd. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,"Heuristic algorithms; Retail stores; Supply chains; Vehicle routing; Virtual reality; Binary exponential backoff; Hybrid Meta-heuristic; Hyper-heuristics; Just in time; Optimisations; Pickup and delivery problems; Soft time windows; Variable neighbourhood descent; Benchmarking",,,,,,,"Belhaiza, S., Hansen, P., Laporte, G., A hybrid variable neighborhood tabu search heuristic for the vehicle routing problem with multiple time windows (2013) Comput.

In the dynamic variant of the problem, not all information is available in advance but is revealed during the planning process. Thus, it is crucial to anticipate future events in order to generate high-quality solutions. Previous work has shown that the use of waiting strategies has the potential to save costs and maximize service quality. We adapt various waiting heuristics to the pickup and delivery problem with time windows. Previous research has shown, that specialized waiting heuristics utilizing anticipatory knowledge potentially outperform general heuristics. Direct policy search based on evolutionary computation and a simulation model is proposed as a methodology to automatically specialize waiting strategies to different problem characteristics. Based on the strengths of the previously introduced waiting strategies, we propose a novel waiting heuristic that can utilize historical request information based on an intensity measure which does not require an additional data preprocessing step. The performance of the waiting heuristics is evaluated on a single set of benchmark instances containing various instance classes that differ in terms of spatial and temporal properties. The diverse set of benchmark instances is used to analyze the influence of spatial and temporal instance properties as well as the degree of dynamism to the potential savings that can be achieved by anticipatory waiting and the incorporation of knowledge about future requests. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Direct policy search; Dynamic pickup and delivery problem; Simulation-based optimization; Waiting strategies",,,,,,,,"Affenzeller, M., Winkler, S., Wagner, S., Beham, A., (2009) Genetic algorithms and genetic programming: Modern concepts and practical applications (Numerical Insights), , Chapman & Hall, UK; Attanasio, A., Cordeau, J.F., Ghiani, G., Laporte, G., Parallel tabu search heuristics for the dynamic multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2004) Parallel Computing, 30 (3), pp. 377-387; Beham, A., Kofler, M., Wagner, S., Affenzeller, M., Coupling simulation with heuristiclab to solve facility layout problems.

A carrier has only a limited capacity within his own vehicle fleet. Therefore the carrier can only serve a selection of customers. Transport requests of clients are accepted only if they contribute to a higher total profit. A paired pickup and delivery selection problem is hardly investigated in literature. In case the carrier has a fixed fleet with a set of drivers, it is realistic that drivers have to be paid whether the truck is used or not. This leads to a fixed cost per vehicle in the decision problem. This practical aspect is modeled with the Pickup and Delivery with selection of customers. A mixed-integer programming formulation is given. A meta-heuristic method, more specifically a tabu-embedded simulated annealing algorithm, is developed to solve the problem in an efficient way.

The two objectives are to minimize the total routing distance and the users' waiting time aboard the vehicles, respectively. The problem can be considered as a generalization of the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (PDPTW) that is known to be NP-hard.

Due to long term contract or for other commercial reasons, some of the requests cannot be neglected, even if they do not contribute fully to profit. This practical aspect is modeled with the Pickup and Delivery with selection of customers. A mixed-integer programming formulation is given. It is indicated how the problem is solved by means of a meta-heuristic, more specifically a tabu-embedded simulated annealing algorithm. © 2015 EUROSIS-ETI.","Optimisation; Pickup and delivery problem; Rneta-heuristics; Vehicle routing","Concurrent engineering; Fleet operations; Integer programming; Pickups; Profitability; Sales; Simulated annealing; Transportation routes; Vehicles; Less-than-truckload; Long-term contracts; Mixed integer programming; Operational planning; Optimisations; Pickup and delivery problems; Rneta-heuristics; Simulated annealing algorithms; Vehicle routing",,,,,,,"Aksen, D., Aras, N., Customer selection and profit maximization in vehicle routing problems (2006) Operations Research Proceedings 2005, pp. 37-42. , (eds.)

The m-MDPDPTW is a variant of pick-up and delivery problem (PDP) and a challenging problem in the field of vehicle routing problem (VRP). The aim is to discover a set of satisfying solutions (routes) minimizing total travel distance, total tardiness time and the total number of vehicles. These routes satisfy transportation requests without contravening any of the instance specific constraints (precedence, capacity and time window constraints). In our problem each request is transported by one of the vehicles between paired pick-up and delivery locations. Such that, the depot does not retain the goods. In this paper, we assume that all vehicles have the same capacity and depart from and return to the same depot. The new encoding and structure algorithm on which this contribution is based uses a genetic algorithm, a selection process using ranking with several Pareto fronts and an elitist selection strategy for replacement. An improved encoding chromosome path representation is given to simulate the process of evolution using several types of populations in different sizes. The performance of the new algorithm is tested on data sets instances of Li & Lim’s PDPTW benchmark problems. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm gives good results. © 2015, Budapest Tech Polytechnical Institution.

Its different basic variants have been widely explored in the literature. Even though it has been studied for years, the research around it is still very active. The new tendency is mainly focused on applying this study case to real-life problems. Due to this trend, the Rich VRP arises: combining multiple constraints for tackling realistic problems. Nowadays, some studies have considered specific combinations of real-life constraints to define the emerging Rich VRP scopes.

Such external resources include vehicles from closely related subcontractors in vertical cooperations, autonomous common carriers on the transportation market, and cooperating partners in horizontal coalitions. In this paper, the transportation planning process of forwarders is studied and the benefit of including external resources is analyzed. By introducing subcontracting, the conventional routing of own vehicles is extended to an integrated operational transportation planning, which simultaneously constructs fulfillment plans with overall lowest costs using the own fleet and subcontractors' vehicles. This is then combined with planning strategies, which intend to increase the profitability by exchanging requests among members in horizontal coalitions. Computational results show considerable cost reductions using the proposed planning approach. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The logistics aspect of our approach is to design and execute a network system where ""premium"" goods are acquired from vendors at multiple locations in the supply network and delivered to customers. Our specific goals are to: (i) investigate the role of premium product offerings in creating critical mass and profit; (ii) develop a model for the multiple-pickup single-delivery vehicle routing problem in the presence of multiple vendors; (iii) propose a hybrid solution approach. To solve the problem introduced in this paper, we develop a hybrid metaheuristic approach that uses a Genetic Algorithm for vendor selection and allocation, and a modified savings algorithm for the capacitated VRP with multiple pickup, single delivery and time windows (CVRPMPDTW). The proposed Genetic Algorithm guides the search for optimal vendor pickup location decisions, and for each generated solution in the genetic population, a corresponding CVRPMPDTW is solved using the savings algorithm. We validate our solution approach against published VRPTW solutions and also test our algorithm with Solomon instances modified for CVRPMPDTW. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper we address the pickup-and-delivery version of this problem and consider further generalization by allowing transshipment in the network. Moreover, we allow heterogenous vehicles and flexible fleet size. We describe mixed integer-programming formulations for the problem with and without time windows for services. The number of constraints and variables in the models are bounded by polynomial size of the problem. We discuss several problem variants that are either captured by our models or can be easily captured through simple modifications. Computational work gave promising results and confirms that transshipment in network can indeed enhance optimization. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In such coalitions, transportation requests from different carriers are exchanged in order to reduce the total fulfillment costs. In this paper, the CTP for a set of independent carriers exchanging less-than-truckload transportation requests is considered. The realistic restriction that all collaborating partners have only limited capacities in their fleets is included in the consideration. To keep their autonomy, coalition members keep their sensitive information including customer payments and cost structures unexposed during CTP. A new decentralized request exchange mechanism for CTP is proposed while only vehicle routes are considered for exchange. It is tested on some newly generated instances and the CTP solutions are compared with those obtained by isolated planning without collaboration and those obtained by a heuristic approach for the centralized planning problem. The results indicate that our mechanism is very efficient and effective in terms of realizing potential cost-savings by CTP, even when capacity limitations and restrictions on the exposure of information are explicitly considered. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Collaborative transportation planning; Freight carrier coalition; Request exchange; Request selection and pickup and delivery problem with time windows",,,,,,,,"Bent, R., van Hentenryck, P., A two-stage hybrid algorithm for pickup and delivery vehicle routing problems with time windows (2003) Lecture notes in computer science 2833/2003.

The proposed method chains trips made by reservations at least 30 minutes before the customer pick-up times. In this paper, the taxi dispatching system, Singapore Taxi Advance Reservation (STAR), is defined. A novel trip-chaining strategy based on a customized algorithm of Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Window (PDPTW) is proposed. The idea is to chain several taxi trips with demand time points that are spread out within a reasonable period of time and with each pick-up point in close proximity to the previous drop-off location. The strategy proposed has the potential to lower the taxi reservation fee in Singapore to encourage advance reservations that facilitate trip chaining, which translates to lower taxi fares for customers, higher revenue for taxi drivers, and lower fleet ownership cost for taxi companies. © 2014 National Center for Transit Research.",,,,,,,,,"Beaudry, A., Laporte, G., Melo, T., Nickel, S., Dynamic transportation of patients in hospitals (2010) OR Spectrum, 32, pp. 77-107; Borndorfer, R., Grotschel, M., Klostermeier, F., Kuttner, C., (1997) Telebus Berlin: Vehicle scheduling in a dial-a-ride system, , Technical Report SC 97-23, Konrad-Zuse-Zentrum fur Informationstechnik Berlin; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., (2002) The dial-a-ride problem: Variants, modeling issues and algorithms, , Technical Report, ISSN: 0711-2440, Les Cahiers du GERAD, Montreal; Gendreau, M., Hertz, A., Laporte, G., A Tabu search heuristic for the vehicle routing problem (1994) Management Science, 40, pp. 1276-1290; Glover, F., Laguna, M., (1997) Tabu Search, , Kluwer, Boston, MA; Jorgensen, R.M., Larsen, J., Bergvinsdottir, K.B., Solving the dial-a-ride problem using genetic algorithms (2007) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 58, pp. 1321-1331; Lau, H.C., Liang, Z., Pickup and delivery problem with time windows: Algorithms and test case generation (2002) International Journal of Artificial Intelligence Tools, 11 (3), pp. 455-472; Li, H., Lim, A., A metaheuristic for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2001) Proceeding of the 13th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI’01), , Dallas, Texas; Madsen, O.B.G., Ravn, H.F., Rygaard, J.M., A Heuristic algorithm for a dial-a-ride problem with time windows, multiple capacities and multiple objectives (1995) Annals of Operations Research, 60, pp. 193-208; Parragh, S.N., Doerner, K.F., Hartl, R.F., A survey on pickup and delivery problems: Part I: Transportation between customers and depot (2008) Journal für Betriebswirtschaft, 58 (1), pp. 21-51. , April 2008, (31); Parragh, S.N., Doerner, K.F., Hartl, R.F., A survey on pickup and delivery problems: Part II: Transportation between pickup and delivery location (2008) Journal für Betriebswirtschaft, 58 (1), pp. 81-117. , April 2008, (31); Parragh, S.N., Doerner, K.F., Hartl, R.F., Gandibleux, X., A heuristic two-phase solution approach for the multi-objective dial-a-ride problem (2009) Networks, 54, pp. 227-242; (2009) Paramics User and Reference Manual, Version 6.6.1, , Quadstone, Quadstone Ltd., Edinburgh, Scotland; Savelsbergh, M.W.P., Local search for routing problems with time windows (1995) Annals of Operations Research, 4, pp. 285-305; Solomon, M.M., Algorithms for the vehicle routing and scheduling problems with time window constrains (1987) Operations Research, 35, pp. 254-264; Toth, P., Vigo, D., Heuristic algorithms for the handicapped persons transportation problem (1997) Transportation Science, 31, pp. 60-71; Toth, P., Vigo, D., (2000) The vehicle routing problem, , Philadelphia, USA; William, P.N., Barnes, J.W., Solving the pickup and delivery problem with time windows using Tabu search (2000) Transportation Research, 34B, pp. 107-121","Wang, H.; Ningbo Institute of Technology, Zhejiang UniversityChina",,,"University of South Florida",,,,,1077291X,,,,"English","J.

We address the PDP with Transfers (PDP-T), in which vehicles plan to transfer items between one another to form more efficient schedules. We introduce the Very Large Neighborhood Search with Transfers (VLNS-T) algorithm to form schedules for the PDP-T. Our approach allows multiple transfers for items at arbitrary locations, and is not restricted to a set of predefined transfer points. We show that VLNS-T improves upon the best known PDP solutions for benchmark problems, and demonstrate its effectiveness on problems sampled from real world taxi data in New York City.

For high quality goods or because of reliability and trustiness, customers prohibit subcontracting for some of their requests (compulsory requests). In this paper we present an approach for solving the integrated problem in case of the existence of compulsory requests. The presented approach is based on an adaptive large neighborhood search and on a column generation procedure. By means of this approach we quantify the increase of fulfillment costs which is caused by different kinds of compulsiveness of transportation requests. A first benchmark study shows that our heuristic approach for the integrated problem with compulsion outperforms the only approach found in literature for that problem, and therefore justifies the investigation of our main study with 6960 test instances.

The traditional objective of distribution management has been upgraded to minimizing system-wide costs related to economic and environmental issues. Reflecting the environmental sensitivity of vehicle routing problems (VRP), an extensive literature review of Green Vehicle Routing Problems (GVRP) is presented. We provide a classification of GVRP that categorizes GVRP into Green-VRP, Pollution Routing Problem, VRP in Reverse Logistics, and suggest research gaps between its state and richer models describing the complexity in real-world cases. The purpose is to review the most up-to-date state-of-the-art of GVRP, discuss how the traditional VRP variants can interact with GVRP and offer an insight into the next wave of research into GVRP. It is hoped that OR/MS researchers together with logistics practitioners can be inspired and cooperate to contribute to a sustainable industry. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The m-MDPDPTW is a class of vehicles routing problem which must construct a set of routes in order to satisfy transportation requests, between the origins nodes (pickup customers) and the destination nodes (delivery customers), satisfying precedence, capacity and time constraints. Each load has to be transported by one of the vehicles, between pickup and delivery customers. We are assuming that all vehicles have the same capacity and each one start and finish route at the same depot. We present, in this paper, a brief literature review of the MDPDPTW and construct a mathematical model of the above problem. We present our approach based on genetic algorithms to give a set of feasible solutions to the m-MDPDPTW minimizing total travel distance. © 2013 IEEE.","Genetic algorithm; Multi-depot vehicle routing problem; Pickup and delivery problem; Time windows","Destination nodes; Feasible solution; Literature reviews; Multi-depot vehicle routing problems; Pickup and delivery; Pickup and delivery problem with time windows; Pickup and delivery problems; Time windows; Constraint satisfaction problems; Customer satisfaction; Information technology; Mathematical models; Sales; Vehicle routing; Genetic algorithms",,,,,,,"Parragh Sophie, N., Karl, F.D., Richard, F.H., A survey on pickup and delivery problems, Part I, II: Transportation between customers and depot JFB, 58, pp. 21-51. , Springer-2008; Christofides, N., Mingozzi Et, A., Toth, P., The vehicle routing problem (1979) Combinatorial Optimization, 11, pp. 315-338. , John Wiley; Lenstra Et, J., Rinnooy Kan, A., Complexity of the vehicle routing and scheduling problems Networks, 11, pp. 221-228. , Springer-1981; Sol Et, M., Savelsbergh, M., A branch-and-rice algorithm for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (1994) Memorandum COSOR 94-22, Eindoven, the Netherlands; Quan, L., Maged, E.T.M., A new insertion-based construction heuristic for solving the pickup and delivery problem with time windows"".

The variants thus formed are supported by a well-developed literature, including a large variety of heuristics. This article first reviews the main classes of attributes, providing a survey of heuristics and meta-heuristics for Multi-Attribute Vehicle Routing Problems (MAVRP). It then takes a closer look at the concepts of 64 remarkable meta-heuristics, selected objectively for their outstanding performance on 15 classic MAVRP with different attributes. This cross-analysis leads to the identification of ""winning strategies"" in designing effective heuristics for MAVRP. This is an important step in the development of general and efficient solution methods for dealing with the large range of vehicle routing variants. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It concerns the delivery of drugs and medical devices from the home care company's pharmacy to patients' homes, delivery of special drugs from a hospital to patients, pickup of bio samples and unused drugs and medical devices from patients. The problem can be considered as a special vehicle routing problem with simultaneous delivery and pickup and time windows, with four types of demands: delivery from depot to patient, delivery from a hospital to patient, pickup from a patient to depot and pickup from a patient to a medical lab. Each patient is visited by one vehicle and each vehicle visits each node at most once. Patients are associated with time windows and vehicles with capacity. Two mixed-integer programming models are proposed. We then propose a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and a Tabu Search (TS) method. The GA is based on a permutation chromosome, a split procedure and local search. The TS is based on route assignment attributes of patients, an augmented cost function, route re-optimization, and attribute-based aspiration levels. These approaches are tested on test instances derived from existing VRPTW benchmarks. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This problem combines the traveling salesman problem (or the vehicle routing problem) and object distribution. The selective pickup and delivery problem (SPDP) is a novel variant of the PDP that enables selectivity of pickup nodes for particular applications. Specifically, the SPDP seeks a shortest route that can supply all delivery nodes with required commodities from some pickup nodes. The two key factors in the SPDP-travel distance and vehicle capacity required-form a tradeoff in essence. This study formulates the biobjective selective pickup and delivery problem (BSPDP) for minimization of travel distance and vehicle capacity required. To resolve the BSPDP, we propose a multiobjective memetic algorithm (MOMA) based on NSGA-II and local search.

In this problem there is a customer set which is partitioned into two subsets: the customers requiring an amount of product (delivery) and the customers providing the product (pickup). There is also a set of transportation requests, which specify the quantity of product that has to be picked up from an origin customer and delivered to a destination customer. There exist a number of vehicles available to be used for completing these tasks. PDP consists of finding a collection of routes with minimum cost, such that all transportation request are serviced. Traditionally, the number of routes has been minimized first, and then the travel distance, however, if these objectives are considered to be equally important, the problem can be tackled as a bi-objective problem. Moreover, time is not always directly proportional to distance, thus travel time can also be considered an important criterion to be optimized and, consequently, PDP has to be regarded as a tri-objective problem. In this paper, we solve PDP as a problem with multiple objectives by means of an evolutionary algorithm and evaluate its performance with proper multi-objective performance tools. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Evolutionary approach; Multi objective; Multiple objectives; Number of vehicles; Performance tools; Pickup and delivery problem with time windows; Pickup and delivery problems; Real-life applications; Evolutionary algorithms; Transportation routes; Sales",,,,,,,"Laporte, G., Fifty years of vehicle routing (2009) Transport.

Drayage in intermodal container terminals involves the pick up and delivery of containers at customer locations, and the main objective is normally the assignment of transportation tasks to the different vehicles, often with the presence of time windows. This scheduling has traditionally been done once a day and, under these conditions, any unexpected event could cause timetable delays. We propose to use the real-time knowledge about vehicle position to solve this problem, which permanently allows the planner to reassign tasks in case the problem conditions change. This exact knowledge of the position of the vehicles is possible due to the use of a geographic positioning system by satellite (GPS, Galileo, Glonass), and the results show that these additional data can be used to dynamically improve the solution. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Drayage; Dynamic; Heuristics; Intermodality; Real-time","Additional datum; Drayage; Dynamic approaches; GALILEO; GLONASS; Heuristics; Inter modalities; Intermodal container terminals; Intermodal transport; Pickup and delivery; Positioning system; Real-time; Time windows; Transit time; Unexpected events; Vehicle position; Containers; Dynamics; Scheduling; Tracking (position); Problem solving",,,,,,,"Banzhaf, W., The molecular traveling salesman (1990) Biological Cybernetics, 64 (1), pp. 7-14; Bodin, L., Golden, B., Assad, A., Ball, M., Routing and scheduling of vehicles and crews: The state of the art (1983) Computers and Operations Research, 10 (2), pp. 63-211; Bodin, L., Mingozzi, A., Baldacci, R., Ball, M., The rollon-rolloff vehicle routing problem (2000) Transportation Science, 34 (3), pp. 271-288; Braekers, K., Caris, A., Janssens, G., Integrated planning of loaded and empty container movements (2012) OR Spectrum, pp. 1-22. , 10.1007/s00291-012-0284-5; Braysy, O., Gendreau, M., Vehicle routing problem with time windows.

In such operations, a dispatch system chains multiple trips to form a route and offers the route to a taxi driver. This unique problem is known as the Singapore taxi advance reservation with electric vehicles problem. Because electric vehicles have a limited running time before recharging is needed, the problem of minimizing the number of taxis used is formulated as a customized paired pickup and delivery problem with a time window and a charging station. A two-phase heuristic approach was proposed for solving this problem. Numerical experiments compared three solutions (nearest neighbor, sweep, and earliest time insertion heuristics), the effect of various battery recharging plans, and the effect of various numbers of charging stations for a simulated central business district network in Singapore. The results showed that (a) the earliest time insertion heuristic produced the best initial solutions; (b) as the maximum running time before recharging increased, the size of the fleet used decreased and there were fewer visits to the charging station, longer running times per taxi, and higher average revenues per driver; and (c) changing the number of charging stations had little effect on the system's performance measures.",,"Charging (batteries); Electric vehicles; Heuristic methods; Problem solving; Taxicabs; Advance reservation;

This paper introduces a new version of the heterogeneous PDP in which the capacity of each vehicle can be modified by reconfiguring its interior to satisfy different types of customer demands. The work was motivated by a daily route planning problem arising at a senior activity center. A fleet of configurable vans is available each day to transport participants to and from the center as well as to secondary facilities for rehabilitative and medical treatment. The number of participants and support equipment that a van can accommodate depends on how it is configured.The problem is modeled as a mixed-integer program much the same way as a PDP but with side constraints that add another level of complexity. To find solutions, we developed a two-phase heuristic that makes use of ideas from greedy randomized adaptive search procedures with multiple starts. In phase I, a set of good feasible solutions is constructed using a series of randomized procedures. A representative subset of those solutions is selected as candidates for improvement by solving a max diversity problem. In phase II, an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) heuristic is used to find local optima by reconstructing portions of the feasible routes. Specialized removal and insertion heuristics were designed for this purpose. Also, a specialized route feasibility check with vehicle type reassignment is introduced to take full advantage of the heterogeneous nature of vehicles. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by comparing the solutions it provided over a period of several weeks with those that were used in practice and derived manually. The analysis indicates that anywhere from 30% to 40% savings can be achieved with the multi-start ALNS heuristic. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Adaptive large neighborhood search; Configurable vehicle capacity; Dial-a-ride problem; Heterogeneous vehicles; Pickup and delivery problem","Customer satisfaction; Integer programming; Optimization; Pickups; Trucks; Adaptive large neighborhood searches; Dial-a-ride problem; Heterogeneous vehicles; Pickup and delivery problems; Vehicle capacity; Vehicles; heuristics; neighborhood; public transport; transport vehicle; transportation planning",,,,,,,"Baldacci, R., Battarra, M., Vigo, D., Routing a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles (2008) The Vehicle Routing Problem: Latest Advances and New Challenges, pp. 3-27. , Springer, New York, B.L.

This paper addresses a variant of the PDP where requests can change vehicle during their trip. The transfer is made at specific locations called ""transfer points."" The corresponding problem is called the pickup and delivery problem with transfers (PDPT). Solving the PDPT leads to new modeling and algorithmic difficulties. We propose new heuristics capable of efficiently inserting requests through transfer points. These heuristics are embedded into an adaptive large neighborhood search. We evaluate the method on generated instances and apply it to the transportation of people with disabilities. On these real-life instances we show that the introduction of transfer points can bring significant improvements (up to 9%) to the value of the objective function. © 2013 INFORMS.","Adaptive large neighborhood search; Pickup and delivery problem; Transfers","Optimization; Transportation routes; Adaptive large neighborhood searches; Delivery point; Objective functions; People with disabilities; Pickup and delivery problems; Specific location; Transfers; Pickups",,,,,,,"Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Dynamic pickup and delivery problems (2010) Eur.

In this paper we focus on scheduling for container transfers and encode the problem using a two-part chromosome approach which is then solved using a modified genetic algorithm. In simulation experiments, the performance of the GA-based approach and a sequential job scheduling method are evaluated and compared with different scheduling scenarios. The experimental results show that the GA-based approach can find better solutions which improve the overall performance. The GA-based approach has been implemented in the terminal scheduling system and the live testing results show that the GA-based approach can reduce the overall time-related cost of container transfers at the automated container terminal.

With respect to surveillance functions, this becomes a realistic problem as UAVs are restricted by operating range, data rate, Anti-Jam margins, and cost. Therefore, UAVs must be allocated to pickup targets and then deliver them to a communication range to be able to transmit information back to a command and control HQ. Research on similar problems illustrates the importance of studying dynamic scenarios as most of these problems are dynamic in nature (similar to this one). To maximize the information return to the communication range, the objective of allocating the UAVs is such that the total service time (pickup and delivery) of all the targets is minimized. A heuristic solution has been applied to this problem in previous work showing that good result can be obtained for the static problem. The focus of this research is to extend the work to operate in a dynamic scenario where requests arrive according to a stochastic process. It is shown that a solution to the static problem is also a solution to the dynamic problem. To address how the solution would perform in a dynamic environment, the scalability of the static solution is analyzed. Furthermore, the performance is analyzed under varying degrees of dynamism. Results show that the short execution times of the heuristic solution allow it to be used in a dynamic setup and show good performance under varying arrival rates. Furthermore, the boundaries for the regions of light and heavy load cases were identified and presented. © 2012 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.",,"Command and control; Communication constraints; Dynamic allocations; Dynamic environments; Heuristic solutions; Pickup and delivery; Surveillance function; Vehicle Routing Problems; Random processes; Communication",,,,,,,"Best, R.A., Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Programs: Issues for Congress (2005) CRS Report for Congress, , CRS Web, RL32508, February 22, Library of Congress; Shima, T., Rasmussen, S., UAV Cooperative Decision and Control-Challenges and Practical Approaches (2009) Advances in Design and Control, , Editors, SIAM; Fahlstrom, P.G., Gleason, T.J., Introduction to UAV Systems (2009) 3rd Edition, , UAV Systems Inc; Sabo, C., Cohen, K., SMART Heuristic for Pickup and Delivery Problem with Cooperative UAVs (2011) Air Force Research Laboratory, , AIAA Infotech@Aerospace, St. Louis, Missouri, 29-31 March AIAA-2011-1464; Sen, A., Bulbul, K., A Survey on Multi Trip Vehicle Routing Problem (2008) International Logistics and Supply Chain Congress, , Istanbul, Turkey, Nov; Kara, I., Kara, B.Y., Yetis, M.K., Cumulative Vehicle Routing Problems (2007) First International Conference on Combinatorial Optimization and Applications, , COCOCA, China; Gillett, B., Johnson, J., Multi-Terminal Vehicle-Dispatching Algorithm (1976) Omega, 4, pp. 711-718; Garey, R.M., Johnson, D.S., Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness (1979) Bell Laboratories, , Murray Hill, N.

The work presented here was inspired by a daily route planning problem at a regional air carrier who was trying to determine the benefits of transshipment. Accordingly, a primary goal of this paper is identify the circumstances under which measurable cost saving can be achieved when one aircraft transports a request from its origin to an intermediate point and a second aircraft picks it up and delivers it to its final destination. In structuring the analysis, we describe a unique way to model this transshipment option on a directed graph and introduce a specialized two-route insertion heuristic that considers when to exploit this option. Based on the new representation, most existing heuristics for the PDP can be readily extended to handle transshipments. To find solutions, we developed a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) with several novel features. In the construction phase, shipment requests are inserted into routes until all demand is satisfied or no feasible insertion exists. In the improvement phase, an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm is used to modify portions of the feasible routes. Specialized removal and insertion heuristics were designed for this purpose. In the absence of test cases in the literature, we also developed a procedure for randomly generating problem instances. Testing was done on 56 existing PDP instances which have 50 requests each, and on 50 new data sets with 25 requests each and one transshipment location. For the former, the performance and solution quality of the GRASP were comparable to the best known heuristics. For the latter, GRASP found the solutions within 1% of optimality on 88% of the instances. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

NCL differs from other declarative languages: It models problems naturally in a simplified form of first-order logic with quantifiers, Boolean logic, numeric constraints, set operations and logical functions; it solves problems by mixed set programming over the mixed domain of real numbers, integers, Booleans, dates/times, references, and in particular sets. The book uses plenty of examples and tutorials to illustrate NCL and its applications. It is intended for researchers and developers in the fields of logic programming, constraint programming, optimization, modeling, operations research and artificial intelligence, who will learn from a new programming language and theoretical foundations for industrial applications. © 2012 by Science Press.

Main reasons for launching public bike program is to reduce carbon footprint so as to prevent greenhouse effect and to solve Last-Mile problem in order to make convenient for citizens. However, we may encounter awkward cases in peak hours (from 7:00 to 9:00 and 17:00 to 19:00) that no bike is available at some stations or no vacant place is left to put bikes. The actual solution in most cities is in a traditional way based on call centers. A personnel taking charge of bikes in a certain zone reallocates bikes among bike stations based on notification of bike users by telephone call when bike stations are full or empty. This inefficient solution will reduce bike utilization and even annoy bike users. In this paper, we propose a system & methodology to intelligently guide personnel to reallocate bikes among stations, aiming at overcoming the above awkward cases and maximizing bike utilization. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Call centers; Telephone calls; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Greenhouse effect; Bicycles",,,,,,,"DeMaio, P., Bike sharing: Its history, models of provision, and future Velo City Conference, 2009; Ropke, S., Cordeau, J., Laport, G., Models and branch-and-cut algorithms for pickup and delivery problems with time windows (2007) Networks, 49 (4), pp. 258-272; Ropke, S., Cordeau, J., Branch and cut and price for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2009) Transportation Science, 43 (3), pp. 267-286; Li, H., Lim, A., A metaheuristic for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows International Conference of Tools Artificial Intelligence, 2001; Lai, M., Cao, E., An improved differential evolution algorithm for vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickups and deliveries and time windows (2010) Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 23 (2), pp. 188-195; Lu, Q., Dessouky, M., An exact algorithm for the multiple vehicle pickup and delivery problem (2004) Transportation Science, 38 (4), pp. 503-514; Baldacci, R., Mingozzi, A., An exact algorithm for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2011) Operations Research, 59 (2), pp. 414-426; IBM Ilog Cplex Solver 12.0","Li, J.; Supply Chain Management and Logistics Research, IBM Research-China, Diamond Building 19-A, Donbeiwang West Road No.8, Beijing, 100193, China; email: ljinfeng@cn.ibm.com",,,,"2012 9th IEEE International Conference on Networking, Sensing and Control, ICNSC 2012","11 April 2012 through 14 April 2012","Beijing",90782,,9781467303880,,,"English","Proc.

These approaches are designed and optimized for specific types of vehicle routing problems (VRPs). VRPs appearing in practice typically accommodate restrictions that are not accommodated in classical VRP models, such as time-dependent travel times and driving hours regulations. We present a new construction framework for solving VRPs that can handle a wide range of different types of VRPs. In addition, this framework accommodates various restrictions that are not considered in classical vehicle routing models, but that regularly appear in practice. Within this framework, restricted dynamic programming is applied to the VRP through the giant-tour representation. This algorithm is a construction heuristic which for many types of restrictions and objective functions leads to an optimal algorithm when applied in an unrestricted way. We demonstrate the flexibility of the framework for various restrictions appearing in practice. The computational experiments demonstrate that the framework competes with state of the art local search methods when more realistic constraints are considered than in classical VRPs. Therefore, this new framework for solving VRPs is a promising approach for practical applications. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We seek to understand the state of the art in VRP in the context of sustainable supply chain and proposed new six VRP variants encountered in sustainable supply chain routing (SSCR) context but have not been given attention to hitherto. These variants of the classical VRP are complex and pertaining to six domains of SSCR. Constraints relevant to sustainable aspect/implications are considered in all the variants. This paper is devoted to the development of framework and comprehensive review on these six variants of SSCR problems.

In this paper a general heuristic to construct an initial feasible solution is proposed and compared with other construction methods. New route reconstruction heuristics are then shown to improve on this. These reconstruction heuristics look to reorder individual routes and recombine multiple routes to decrease the number of vehicles used in the solution. A tabu search scheme where the attribute to be recorded has been specifically adapted to the PDPTW is proposed. A new method based on branch and bound optimisation attempts to optimise the final ordering of requests in routes to further improve the solutions.

To adjust to this trend and gain a competitive advantage, competition among shipping companies at home and abroad has intensified, and many efforts are being made for the improvement of customer services and cost saving. In particular, car carriers transporting more than 80% of total car import/export volume must quickly make efforts to reduce transportation costs. Much research has been conducted to improve the efficiency of maritime transportation, but studies on car carriers, which are given relatively less importance, have been lacking. The car carrier's transportation planning is similar to the vehicle routing problem, but it is much more complicated in that cars and cargo are prepared at different points in time, and cargo can be loaded not only at the departing port but also at other ports. Therefore, in an effort to solve the problem, this study has developed a meta-heuristic algorithm based on a genetic algorithm, and we have succeeded in developing a maritime transportation planning support system with the algorithm, thus making it possible to prepare various alternatives, evaluate them, and consequently support user's decision making. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Decision support system; Genetic algorithm; Maritime transportation; Routing problem","Competitive advantage; Cost saving; Customer services; Maritime transportation; Meta heuristic algorithm; Port logistics; Routing problems; Shipping companies; Transportation cost; Transportation planning; Vehicle Routing Problems; Artificial intelligence; Competition; Decision support systems; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Ports and harbors; Waterway transportation",,,,,"Grant Foundation; KFCR, Korean Foundation for Cancer Research","Acknowledgements “This work was supported by the Korea Research Foundation Grant funded by the Korean Government (MOEHRD)” (The Regional Research Universities Program/Research Center for Logistics Information Technology).","Alfredo, O., Omar, V., Adaptive memory programming for the vehicle routing problem with multiple trips (2005) Comput Oper Res, 34 (1), pp. 28-47; Al-Khayyal, F., Hwang, S.-J., Inventory constrained maritime routing and scheduling for multi-commodity liquid bulk, Part I: Applications and model (2007) European Journal of Operational Research, 176 (1), pp. 106-130. , DOI 10.1016/j.ejor.2005.06.047, PII S0377221705005771; Bäck, T., (1996) Evolutionary Algorithms in Theory and Practice: Evolutionary Strategies, Evolutionary Programming, Genetic Algorithms, , Oxford University Press, London; Badeau, P., Guertin, F., Gendreau, M., Potvin, J., Taillard, E., A parallel tabu search heuristic for the vehicle routing problem with time windows (1997) Transp Res, Part C, Emberging Technol, 5, pp. 109-122; Bagchi, S., Uckun, S., Miyabe, Y., Kawamura, K., Exploring problem-specific recombination operators for job shop scheduling (1991) Proc.

Based on this insertion heuristic, a genetic algorithm for pickup and delivery problem with time windows (PDPTW) is proposed. Comparing with other genetic algorithms, our algorithm holds two characters: 1) Cross operation as well as R1- mutation operation and R2- mutation operation are based on time difference insertion heuristic; 2) Non-generation search strategy is applied to the algorithm. Our algorithm is subject to a comparative test on the benchmark problem sets that comprise 56 PDPTW instances.

One important variant of the VRP is the Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (PDPTW), where it is assumed that a client may request one of two service types, a pickup or a delivery. It is required to find a set of minimum cost routes for a fleet of vehicles, while observing a number of predefined constraints. In this research, we try to handle the difficult constraints using a new solution representation and simple neighborhood moves that will maintain the feasibility of solutions throughout the search. Our solution method is tried within two meta-heuristic approaches, a Genetic Algorithm and a Simulated Annealing.

With respect to surveillance functions, this becomes a realistic problem as UAVs are restricted by operating range, data rate, Anti-Jam margins, and cost. Therefore, UAVs must be allocated to ""pickup"" targets and then ""deliver"" them, from within a prescribed communication space, back to a command and control HQ. To maximize the speed/amount of information transmitted from this communication region, the objective of allocating the UAVs is such that the total service time (pickup and delivery) of all the targets is minimized. Previous work on PDPs has shown that as the problem gets more complicated (i.e. more targets and more vehicles) the solution space increases exponentially, and the execution time to find an optimal solution is impossible to implement. Additionally, previously related work using a heuristic solution has been applied to this problem showing that good result can be maintained (within ~15-20% of the optimal solution for small cases). The focus of this research is to develop an alternate heuristic algorithm, deemed SMART from here on, that can perform near optimally (within ~5%) and scales as the problem gets more complicated. Also, the algorithm is developed such that it is easily extendable to a dynamic scenario as this research progresses. This algorithm is described in detail and has shown that it reaches this performance metric while requiring a significantly reduced computational time when compared to the time needed to obtain the optimal solution. © 2011 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

The problem arises from an on-demand transportation system developed in a rural zone in France, where the objective of encouraging people meeting is pursued. We address the solution of the problem with a column generation approach, applied to a set partitioning formulation where the objective function is fractional. Based on the literature on linear fractional programming, two methods are developed to deal with this fractional objective. Experiments permit to compare these two approaches and to evaluate the impact of the new objective compared to a standard min-cost or min-time optimization. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Such systems may be used for modelling an organisation with a high level of complexity, with functionalities on different levels, realising heterogeneous activities.We use concepts and assumptions offered by multi-agent and holonic approaches. Theoretic representation of the abstract holon structure is given and a model for building a realisation for a domain, focusing especially on building and reorganising holons. The domain is the management of the transportation company and a delivery strategy for it.

Athena, Greece","In the dynamic Pickup and Delivery Problem with Transfers (dPDPT), a set of transportation requests that arrive at arbitrary times must be assigned to a fleet of vehicles. We use two cost metrics that capture both the company's and the customer's viewpoints regarding the quality of an assignment. In most related problems, the rule of thumb is to apply a two-phase local search algorithm to heuristically determine a good requests-to-vehicles assignment. This work proposes a novel solution based on a graph-based formulation of the problem that treats each request independently. Briefly, in this conceptual graph, the goal is to find a shortest path from a node representing the pickup location to that of the delivery location. However, we show that efficient Bellman-Ford or Dijkstra-like algorithms cannot be applied. Still, our method is able to find dPDPT solutions significantly faster than a conventional two-phase local search algorithm, while the quality of the solution is only marginally lower. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","dynamic shortest path; Pickup and delivery problem","Bellman-Ford; Conceptual graph; Cost metrics; Dynamic shortest path; Graph-based; Local search algorithm; Novel solutions; Pickup and delivery; Pickup and delivery problem; Pickup and delivery problems; Rule of thumb; Shortest path; Fleet operations; Graph theory; Learning algorithms; Pickups",,,,,,,"Agrawal, R., Jagadish, H.V., Materialization and incremental update of path information (1989) ICDE, pp. 374-383; Bent, R., Hentenryck, P.V., A two-stage hybrid algorithm for pickup and delivery vehicle routing problems with time windows (2006) Computers and Operations Research, 33 (4), pp. 875-893; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., Dynamic pickup and delivery problems (2010) European Journal of Operational Research, 202 (1), pp. 8-15; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.F., Gribkovskaia, I., Laporte, G., Static pickup and delivery problems: A classification scheme and survey (2007) TOP, 15, pp. 1-31; Carraway, R.L., Morin, T.L., Moskowitz, H., Generalized dynamic programming for multicriteria optimization (1990) European Journal of Operational Research, 44 (1), pp. 95-104; Cheng, J., Yu, J.X., On-line exact shortest distance query processing (2009) EDBT, pp. 481-492; Cohen, E., Halperin, E., Kaplan, H., Zwick, U., Reachability and distance queries via 2-hop labels (2002) SODA, pp. 937-946; Cooke, K.L., Halsey, E., The shortest route through a network with time-dependent internodal transit times (1966) Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications, 14 (3), pp. 493-498; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., Ropke, S., Recent Models and Algorithms for One-to-One Pickup and Delivery Problems (2008) Vehicle Routing: Latest Advances and Challenges, pp. 327-357. , Kluwer, Dordrecht; Cordeau, J.F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54 (3), pp. 573-586; Cortés, C.E., Matamala, M., Contardo, C., The pickup and delivery problem with transfers: Formulation and a branch-and-cut solution method (2010) European Journal of Operational Research, 200 (3), pp. 711-724; Ding, B., Yu, J.X., Qin, L., Finding time-dependent shortest paths over large graphs (2008) EDBT, pp. 205-216; Dreyfus, S.E., An appraisal of some shortest-path algorithms (1969) Operations Research, 17 (3); Dumas, Y., Desrosiers, J., Soumis, F., The pickup and delivery problem with time windows (1991) European Journal of Operational Research, 54 (1), pp. 7-22; Gendreau, M., Guertin, F., Potvin, J.Y., Séguin, R., Neighbourhood search heuristics for a dynamic vehicle dispatching problem with pick-ups and deliveries (2006) Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 14 (3), pp. 157-174; Goldberg, A.V., Harrelson, C., Computing the shortest path: A search meets graph theory (2005) SODA 2005: Proceedings of the Sixteenth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, pp. 156-165; Goldberg, A.V., Kaplan, H., Werneck, R.F., Reach for A*: Efficient point-to-point shortest path algorithms (2006) Proc. of the 8th WS on Algorithm Engineering and Experiments (ALENEX), pp. 129-143. , SIAM, Philadelphia; Granat, J., Guerriero, F., The interactive analysis of the multicriteria shortest path problem by the reference point method (2003) European Journal of Operational Research, 151 (1), pp. 103-118; Guerriero, F., Musmanno, R., Label correcting methods to solve multicriteria shortest path problems (2001) Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications, 111 (3), pp. 589-613; Jing, N., Huang, Y.W., Rundensteiner, E.A., Hierarchical encoded path views for path query processing: An optimal model and its performance evaluation (1998) TKDE, 10 (3), pp. 409-432; Jung, S., Pramanik, S., An efficient path computation model for hierarchically structured topographical road maps (2002) TKDE, 14 (5), pp. 1029-1046; Kriegel, H.P., Renz, M., Schubert, M., Route skyline queries: A multi-preference path planning approach (2010) ICDE, pp. 261-272; Li, H., Lim, A., A metaheuristic for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2001) ICTAI, pp. 333-340; Mitrović-Minić, S., Krishnamurti, R., Laporte, G., Double-horizon based heuristics for the dynamic pickup and delivery problem (2004) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 38 (7), pp. 669-685; Mitrović-Minić, S., Laporte, G., Waiting strategies for the dynamic pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2004) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 38 (7), pp. 635-655; Mitrović-Minić, S., Laporte, G., The pickup and delivery problem with time windows and transshipment (2006) INFOR, 44 (3), pp. 217-228; Orda, A., Rom, R., Shortest-path and minimum-delay algorithms in networks with time-dependent edge-length (1990) J.

The proposed methodology can be divided in two phases, i.e, the construction phase and the refinement phase. In the construction phase, the generation of an initial solution is made through Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) meta-heuristic with the elitism concept. Only the best ant can lay down pheromone, trying to improve the generated solutions by the ants at each iteration. The generated solutions go to the refinement phase through local search with First Improvement Descent Method and three neighborhood structures. After the solution is refined, the pheromone is layered over the covered arcs, helping to guide the next ants. The process is autocatalytic, i.e., the subsequent iterations use the information generated from the previous results, assisting in the convergence and accuracy. The developed methodology was evaluated using a set of standard instances from literature to test its efficiency, generating some better results than those found in literature. © 2010 IEEE.","Ant Colony Optimization; Metaheuristic; Pickup and delivery Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows","Ant colony systems; Ant-colony optimization; Autocatalytic; Construction phase; Descent method; Initial solution; Its efficiencies; Local search; Metaheuristic; Neighborhood structure; Pickup and delivery; Pickup and delivery Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows; Refinement phase; Time windows; Vehicle Routing Problems; Heuristic methods; Iterative methods; Neural networks; Optimization; Pickups; Routing algorithms; Vehicles; Vehicle routing",,,,,,,"Dorigo, M., Gambardella, L.M., Ant colony system: A cooperative learning approach to the traveling salesman problem (1997) IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 1 (1), pp. 53-66. , PII S1089778X97033031; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., Salvelbergh, M.W.P., Vigo, D., Vehicle routing (2005) Handbooks in Operational Research and Management Science; Parragh, S., Doerner, K., Hartl, R., A survey on pickup and delivery problems part ii: Transportation between pickup and delivery locations (2008) Journal für Betriebswirtschaft, 58 (2), pp. 81-117. , June; Parragh, S., Doerner, K., Hartl, R., A survey on pickup and delivery problems part i: Transportation between customers and depot (2008) Journal für Betriebswirtschaft, 58 (2), pp. 21-51. , June; Dorigo, M., Maniezzo, V., Colorni, A., Ant system: Optimization by a colony of cooperating agents (1996) IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics, 26 (1), pp. 29-41. , PII S1083441996004177; Gokce, E.Y., (2004) A Revised Ant Colony System Approach to Vehicle Routing Problems, , Master's thesis, Sabanci University, Turkey, July; De Oliveira, S.M., De Souza, S.R., Silva, M.A.L., A solution of dynamic vehicle routing problem with time window via ant colony system metaheuristic (2008) Brazilian Symposium on Neural Networks, 10, pp. 21-26; Donati, A.V., Montemanni, R., Casagrande, N., Rizzoli, A.E., Gambardella, L.M., Time dependent vehicle routing problem with a multi ant colony system (2008) European Journal of Operational Research, 185 (3), pp. 1174-1191. , DOI 10.1016/j.ejor.2006.06.047, PII S0377221706006345; Gambardella, L.M., Taillard, E., Agazzi, G., (1999) Macs-vrptw: A Multiple Ant Colony System for Vehicle Routing Problems with Time Windows, pp. 63-76. , D.

Routing of vehicles leads to optimisation of logistics operations in enterprise networks. The present study addresses multiple-vehicle pick-up and delivery problems with time windows and heterogeneous capacitated vehicles (m-PDPTWH) for the application of blood bank logistics. The focus is to develop a heuristic to solve m-PDPTWH with the objective to maximise the number of requests assigned to vehicles routes and to minimise the total travel cost. Such a description scheme seems to be useful in the context of dynamic routing problems. The objective of this research is to provide a simple and fast meta-heuristic approach designed for the static case, before entrenching it in a dynamic context in future work. We choose simulated annealing (SA) as a search procedure to solve m-PDPTWH due to the reason that there is very limited literature on solving m-PDPTW using SA. Trials on a large number of test-problems have yielded encouraging results. The key contribution of the work is the development of a unified meta-heuristic to solve m-PDPTW and m-PDPTWH for large sized networks. © 2010 Springer-Verlag London.",,,,,,,,,"Spens, K., (2001) Managing Critical Resources through Supply Network Management: A Study of the Finnish Blood Supply Network, , Swedish School of Economics and Business Administration, Helsinki; Lenstra, J.K., Rinnoy Kan, A.H.G., Complexity of vehicle routing and scheduling problems (1981) Networks, 11, pp. 221-227; Toth, P., Vigo, D., (2001) The Vehicle Routing Problem, , eds., SIAM Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, Philadelphia; Psaraftis, H.N., A dynamic programming solution to the single vehicle manyto- many immediate request dial-a-ride problem (1980) Transportation Science, 14, pp. 130-154; Psaraftis, H.N., An exact algorithm for the single vehicle many-to-many diala- ride problem with time windows (1983) Transportation Science, 17, pp. 351-357; Desrosiers, J., Dumas, Y., Soumis, F., A dynamic programming solution of the large scale single-vehicle dial-a-ride problem with time windows (1986) The American Journal of Mathematical and Management Sciences, 6, pp. 301-325; Dumas, Y., Desrosiers, J., Soumis, F., The pickup and delivery problem with time windows (1991) European Journal of Operational Research, 54, pp. 7-22; Savelsbergh, M.W.P., Sol, M., DRIVE: Dynamic routing of independent vehicles (1998) Operations Research, 46, pp. 474-490; Savelsbergh, M.W.P., Sol, M., The general pickup and delivery problem (1995) Transportation Science, 29, pp. 17-29; Bodin, L., Sexton, T., The multi-vehicle subscriber dial-a-ride problem (1986) TIMS Studies in the Management Sciences, 26, pp. 73-86; Desrosiers, J., Dumas, Y., Soumis, F., The multiple vehicle dial-a-ride problem (1988) Computer-aided Transit Scheduling: A Proceedings of the Fourth International Workshop on Computer-Aided Scheduling of Public Transport, pp. 15-27. , Daduna, J.R. and Wren, A.

These problems are generally treated via the representation of the road network as a weighted complete graph. Each arc of the graph represents the shortest route for a possible origin-destination connection. Several attributes can be defined for one arc (travel time, travel cost, etc.), but the shortest route modeled by this arc is computed according to a single criterion, generally travel time. Consequently, some alternative routes proposing a different compromise between the attributes of the arcs are discarded from the solution space. We propose to consider these alternative routes and to evaluate their impact on solution algorithms and solution values through a multigraph representation of the road network. We point out the difficulties brought by this representation for general vehicle routing problems, which drives us to introduce the so-called fixed sequence arc selection problem (FSASP). We propose a dynamic programming solution method for this problem. In the context of an on-demand transportation (ODT) problem, we then propose a simple insertion algorithm based on iterative FSASP solving and a branch-and-price exact method. Computational experiments on modified instances from the literature and on realistic data issued from an ODT system in the French Doubs Central area underline the cost savings brought by the proposed methods using the multigraph model. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In this research, we compare three different approaches to the problem: a genetic algorithm, a simulated annealing approach, and a hill climbing algorithm. In all cases, we adopt a solution representation that depends on a duplicate code for both the pickup request and its delivery. We also present an intelligent neighborhood move, that is guided by the time window, aiming to overcome the difficult problem constraints efficiently.

GES is a recently proposed metaheuristc framework and was first applied to the vehicle routing problem with time windows. The existence of the pickup and delivery constraint makes the feasible solution space tightly constrained and then makes the design of effective metaheuristics more difficult. We demonstrate that GES can be successfully applied to such an complicated problem. Experimental results on the Li and Lim's benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed GES algorithm outperforms existing algorithms and is able to improve 105 best-known solutions out of 298 instances. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Ejection chain; Guided local search; Metaheuristics; Pickup and delivery problem; Vehicle routing","Ejection chain; Feasible solution; Guided Local Search; Metaheuristics; Pickup and delivery; Pickup and delivery problem with time windows; Pickup and delivery problems; Vehicle routing problem with time windows; Combinatorial optimization; Pickups",,,,,,,"Bent, R., Hentenryck, P.V., A two-stage hybrid algorithm for pickup and delivery vehicle routing problems with time windows (2006) Computers and Operations Research, 33, pp. 875-893; Bent, R., Hentenryck, P.V., A Two-stage Hybrid Algorithm for Pickup and Delivery Vehicle Routing Problems with Time Windows, , http://www.cs.brown.edu/people/rbent/pickup-appendix.ps, Appendix; Lau, H., Liang, Z., Pickup and delivery with time windows: Algorithms and test case generation (2001) Proc. of the 13th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence, pp. 333-340; Li, H., Lim, A., A Metaheuristic for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2001) Proc. of the 13th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence, pp. 160-170; Lim, A., Zhang, X., A two-stage heuristic with ejection pools and generalized ejection chains for the vehicle routing problem with time windows (2007) Informs Journal on Computing, 19, pp. 443-457; Kindervater, G.A.P., Savelsbergh, M.W.P., Vehicle routing: Handling edge exchanges (1997) Local Search in Combinatorial Optimization, pp. 337-360. , Wiley, Chichester; Nagata, Y., Bräysy, O., A Powerful route minimization heuristic for the vehicle routing problem with time windows (2009) Operations Research Letters, 37, pp. 333-338; Nagata, Y., Tojo, S., Guided ejection search for the job shop scheduling problem (2009) LNCS, 5482, pp. 168-179. , Cotta, C., Cowling, P.

The first stage uses simulated annealing algorithm to decrease the number of used vehicles, the second stage uses tabu search to decrease the total travel cost. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the algorithm which has produced many new best solutions on problems within 600 customers. In particular, it has improved 45% and 81.7% of the best solutions on the 200 and 600-customer benchmarks, sometimes by as much as 3 vehicles.

In this paper, we develop a stopping and restarting strategy that considers tradeoffs between the computational effort and the probability of obtaining the global optimum. The analysis is based on a stochastic process called Hesitant Adaptive Search with Power-Law Improvement Distribution (HASPLID). HASPLID models the behavior of stochastic optimization algorithms, and motivates an implementable framework, Dynamic Multistart Sequential Search (DMSS).

Based on the booking surcharges, there are generally two categories of taxi bookings, current and advance. Current bookings are requests that taxi should reach the customer immediately or within half an hour, and advance bookings are requests made at least half an hour in advance. In this paper, a novel trip-chaining strategy for taxi advance booking based on a customized algorithm of Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Window (PDPTW) was proposed. The idea is to chain several bookings with demand time points which are spread out within a reasonable period of time, and with each pick-up point coinciding with or being within close proximity to the previous drop-off location.

Thus, offered transport services need to be more and more advanced and better designed to meet users demands. Important cost factors of many goods are transport costs. Therefore, a reduction of costs, a better adjustment of strategies to the demand as well as a better planning and scheduling of available resources are important for the transport companies. This paper is aimed at modelling and simulation of transport systems, involving a dynamic Pickup and Delivery problem with Time Windows and capacity constraints (PDPTW). PDPTW is defined by a set of transport requests which should be performed while minimising costs expressed by the number of vehicles, total distance and total travel time. Each request is described by two locations: pickup and delivery, periods of time when the operations of pickup or delivery can be performed and a load to be transported. The nature of this problem, its distribution and the possibility of using a lot of autonomous planning modules, lead us to use a multi-agent approach. Our approach allows the modeling of entities which do not appear in the classical PDPTW such as company organisation, communication among vehicles, interactions between vehicles and company dispatcher or different strategies of requests acceptation by different vehicles. This paper presents also a software environment and experimentations to validate the proposed approach.","Dynamic pickup and delivery problem with time windows; Multi-agent simulation; Transport planning and scheduling",,,,,,,,"BACHEM, A., HOCHSTATTLER, W., MALICH, M., Simulated Trading a New Parallel Approach for Solving Vehicle Routing Problem (1994) Proceedings of the International Conference Parallel Computing: Trends and Application; BENT, R.W., VAN HENTENRYCK, P., Scenario-Based Planning for Partially Dynamic Vehicle Routing with Stochastic Customers (2004) Operations Research, 52 (6), pp. 977-987; BERTSIMAS, D., SIMCHI-LEVI, D., A New Generation of Vehicle Routing Research: Robust Algorithms, Addressing Uncertainty (1996) Operations Research, 44, pp. 286-304; BRAYSY, O., Genetic Algorithms for the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (2001) Arpakanuus, 1. , Special Issue on Bioinformatics and Genetic Algorithms; BRAYSY, O., GENDREAU, M., (2001) Genetic Algorithms for the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows.

This paper studies a Grouping Genetic Algorithm for solving the PDPTW. The insertionsearching heuristics (in GGA) which can generate feasible solutions was improved, new data structures were built, and then three routing adjustment strategies were added to come up with the Multi-Strategy Grouping Genetic Algorithm (MSGGA). The PDPTW benchmark problems with 100 customers are calculated with MSGGA, and the comparison between the result and that of the reference shows that the new algorithm shortens the calculating time with its astringency, better solutions of four cases are obtained and stability is improved.

Since a limited number of swap containers is available for transportation, two problems arise. 1. Swap containers have to be routed as pickup and delivery requests in multi-hub tours. 2. Day-by-day routing may lead to an imbalance of swap containers requiring a dynamic allocation. Neglecting interdependencies between vehicle routing and resource allocation seems inferior. An integration of the two problems overcomes this deficiency. We formulate mathematical models and propose integration approaches. The advantages of these approaches are discussed based on a computational study. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper introduces a new branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm in which lower bounds are computed by solving through column generation the linear programming relaxation of a set partitioning formulation. Two pricing subproblems are considered in the column generation algorithm: an elementary and nonelementary shortest path problem. Valid inequalities are added dynamically to strengthen the relaxations. Some of the previously proposed inequalities for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows are also shown to be implied by the set partitioning formulation. Computational experiments indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms a recent branch-and-cut algorithm. © 2009 INFORMS.","Branch and cut; Branch and price; Column generation; Pickup and delivery; Valid inequalities","Costs; Graph theory; Linear programming; Pickups; Transportation routes; Branch and cut; Branch and price; Column generation; Pickup and delivery; Valid inequality; Integer programming",,,,,,,"Balas, E., Fischetti, M., Pulleyblank, W.R., The precedenceconstrained asymmetric traveling salesman polytope (1995) Math.

We chose to apply the Multiple Ant Colony System (MACS) approach: two ant colonies minimize the number of vehicles to be routed and the travel lengths; cooperation between colonies is performed by exchanging information through pheromone updating. Besides, we studied a novel strategy to bias the attractiveness of a node depending on its nature, called pheromone post-treatment. The algorithm performances on the number of vehicles needed and the total tour length were comparable to those of the best algorithms in the state of art. © 2008 The authors and IOS Press.

Apart from decreasing prices and increasing competition, freight forwarders have to cope with the fact that demands fluctuate on a short-term basis and that fast adjustments to the constantly changing customer's needs are essential. From this perspective, searching for unexploited possibilities to optimize performance has proved to be an effective means to realize cost-saving targets and can make the difference between 'to be or not to be' for many freight forwarders. On the basis of an analysis conducted in a freight forwarding company, Marta Anna Krajewska identifies two levels of improving logistics performance. First, she demonstrates that on the local level the automated operational transportation planning increases the planning quality and influences mid- and long-term planning issues.

However, increased competitiveness through cost reductions can be achieved if freight carriers cooperate in order to balance their request portfolios. Participation in such coalitions can benefit the entire coalition, as well as each participant individually, thus reinforcing the market position of the partners. The work presented in this paper uniquely combines features of routing and scheduling problems and of cooperative game theory. In the first part, the profit margins resulting from horizontal cooperation among freight carriers are analysed. It is assumed that the structure of customer requests corresponds to that of a pickup and delivery problem with time windows for each freight carrier. In the second part, the possibilities of sharing these profit margins fairly among the partners are discussed. The Shapley value can be used to determine a fair allocation. Numerical results for real-life and artificial instances are presented. © 2008 Operational Research Society Ltd.

In this study, the strategies are tested in a constructive-deconstructive heuristic for the dynamic pickup and delivery problem with hard time windows and random travel times. Comparisons of the solution quality provided by these strategies to a more conventional approach were performed on randomly generated instances up to 100 requests with static and dynamic (time-dependent) travel times and different degrees of dynamism. The results indicate the advantages of the strategies both in terms of lost requests and number of vehicles.","Dynamic pickup and delivery problems; Request buffering; Timedependent travel times; Vehicle waiting","Buffering strategies;

Basically, two problem classes can be distinguished. The first part dealt with the transportation of goods from the depot to linehaul customers and from backhaul customers to the depot. The second part now considers all those problems where goods are transported between pickup and delivery locations, denoted as Vehicle Routing Problems with Pickups and Deliveries (VRPPD). These are the Pickup and Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem (PDVRP - unpaired pickup and delivery points), the classical Pickup and Delivery Problem (PDP - paired pickup and delivery points), and the Dial-A-Ride Problem (DARP - passenger transportation between paired pickup and delivery points and user inconvenience taken into consideration). Single as well as multi vehicle mathematical problem formulations for all three VRPPD types are given, and the respective exact, heuristic, and metaheuristic solution methods are discussed. © Wirtschaftsuniversität Wien, Austria 2008.","Dial-a-ride problem; Pick up and delivery problem; Pickup and delivery vehicle routing; Survey; Transportation",,,,,,"FWF, Austrian Science Fund; 286-N04, FWF, Austrian Science Fund","This work was supported by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) under grant #L286-N04.

Several studies have shown the benefit of split deliveries for the vehicle routing problem, in which a vehicle operating out of a depot makes a series of deliveries on each route. In this paper, we quantify the benefit of using split loads for the pickup and delivery problem. A heuristic to solve the pickup and delivery problem with split loads is developed and applied to a set of random large-scale problem instances, revealing the potential benefit of split loads. This benefit is reduced when the heuristic is applied to a real-world trucking industry problem because of several problem instance characteristics. The benefit of split loads is found to be most closely tied to three characteristics: load size, cost associated with a pickup or delivery, and the frequency with which loads have origins or destinations in common. Prior to a discussion of these results, we define the pickup and delivery problem with split loads and prove that for a set of given origins and destinations the most benefit can occur with load sizes just above one half of vehicle capacity. © 2008 INFORMS.","Split pickup and delivery; Vehicle routing","Pickups; Trucks; Vehicles; Large-scale problem; Number of vehicles; Pickup and delivery; Pickup and delivery problems; Potential benefits; Problem instances; Split pickups; Vehicle Routing Problems; Vehicle routing",,,,,,,"Archetti, C., Speranza, M.G., Hertz, A., A tabu search algorithm for the split delivery vehicle routing problem (2006) Transportation Science, 40 (1), pp. 64-73. , http://www.extenza-eps.com/INF/doi/pdf/10.1287/trsc.1040.0103, DOI 10.1287/trsc.1040.0103; Archetti, C., Savelsbergh, M.W.P., Speranza, M.G., Worst-case analysis for split delivery vehicle routing problems (2006) Transportation Science, 40 (2), pp. 226-234. , http://www.extenza-eps.com/INF/doi/pdf/10.1287/trsc.1050.0117, DOI 10.1287/trsc.1050.0117; Archetti, C., Savelsbergh, M.W.P., Speranza, M.G., To Split or not to split: That is the question (2008) Transportation Res.

Each request originates at one location and is destined for one other location. These requests apply to the transportation of goods or people, in which case the problem is often called the dial-a-ride problem. In recent years, there have been several significant developments in the area of exact and heuristic algorithms for PDPs. The purpose of this chapter is to report on these developments. It contains two main sections devoted to single vehicle and multi-vehicle problems, respectively. Each section is subdivided into two parts, one on exact algorithms and one on heuristics. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008.","Branch-and-cut; Column generation; Dial-a-ride; One-to-one; Pickup and delivery; Tabu search",,,,,,,,"Balas, E., Fischetti, M., Pulleyblank, W.R., The precedenceconstrained asymmetric traveling salesman polytope (1995) Mathematical Programming, 68, pp. 241-265; Bent, R., Van Hentenryck, P., A two-stage hybrid algorithm for pickup and delivery vehicle routing problems with time windows (2006) Computers & Operations Research, 33, pp. 875-893; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Gribkovskaia, I., Laporte, G., Static pickup and delivery problems: A classification scheme and survey (2007) TOP, 15, pp. 1-31; Bianco, L., Mingozzi, A., Ricciardelli, S., Exact and heuristic procedures for the traveling salesman problem with precedence constraints, based on dynamic programming (1994) INFOR, 32, pp. 19-31; Bodin, L.D., Sexton, T., The multi-vehicle subscriber dial-a-ride problem (1986) TIMS Studies in Management Science, 26, pp. 73-86; Borndörfer, R., Grötschel, M., Klostermeier, F., Küttner, C., (1997) Telebus Berlin: Vehicle scheduling in a dial-a-ride system., , Technical Report SC 97-23, Konrad-Zuse-Zentrum für Informationstechnik Berlin; Brønmo, G., Christiansen, M., Fagerholt, K., Nygreen, B., A multistart local search heuristic for ship scheduling-a computational study (2007) Computers & Operations Research, 34, pp. 900-917; Carrabs, F., (2006) Heuristics and exact approaches for transportation problems with pickup and delivery., , Ph.

At first, the multi-vehicle PDPTW problem is transformed into several single-vehicle PDPTW problems by using clustering algorithm, then initial solution for tabu search is constructed by arranging the best solutions of single-vehicle PDPTW problems which obtained by using genetic algorithm, at last the optimal solution is obtained by performing tabu search. In addition, a gradually increase strategy of the number of cluster from the minimal feasible number is proposed, to guarantee the minimization of fleet.

For this reason the construction of an optimal and effective transport planning and scheduling, offering the best use of transport means is hugely important. One of the researched transport problems at present is PDPTW. In this work, the PDPTW problem will be extended by adding changeable and uncertain travel times between given locations, which will then be examined and learnt by the dispatching company system. The changeable travel times are the results of traffic jams forming and propagating. The applied multi-agent approach allows us to consider the problem on the level of a whole company and on the local level analysed by a particular vehicle. The other aspects which are taken into consideration are traffic patterns, whose goal it is to facilitate the optimal routes for the given traffic patterns. These patterns contain the information about the dependencies between the traffic state on the particular routes. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.","Learning; Multi-agent systems; Traffic jams; Transport problems","Computer crime; Learning systems; Multi agent systems; Scheduling; Dispatching company system; PDPTW problem; Traffic jams; Traffic control",,,,,,,"Bachern, A., Hochstattler, W., Malich, M., Simulated Trading A New Parallel Approach for Solving Vehicle Routing Problems (1994) Proc. of Int.

Box 124, NO-0314 Oslo, Norway","Solving the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a key to efficiency in transportation and supply chain management. The VRP is an NP-hard problem that comes in many guises. The VRP literature contains thousands of papers, and VRP research is regarded as one of the great successes of OR. Vehicle routing decision support tools provide substantial savings in society every day, and an industry of routing tool vendors has emerged. Exact methods of today cannot consistently solve VRP instances with more than 50-100 customers in reasonable time, which is generally a small number in real-life applications. For industrial problem sizes, and if one aims at solving a variety of VRP variants, approximation methods is the only viable approach. There is still a need for VRP research, particularly for large-scale instances and complex, rich VRP variants. In this chapter, we give a brief general introduction to the VRP. We then describe how industrial requirements motivate extensions to the basic, rather idealized VRP models that have received most attention in the research community, and how such extensions can be made. At SINTEF Applied Mathematics, industrial variants of the VRP have been studied since 1995. Our efforts have led to the development of a generic VRP solver that has been commercialized through a spin-off company. We give a description of the underlying, rich VRP model and the selected uniform algorithmic approach, which is based on metaheuristics. Finally, results from computational experiments are presented. In conclusion, we point to important issues in further VRP research. © 2007 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Approximation; Logistics; Metaheuristics; Modeling; Optimization; Routing Tool; Transportation; VRP",,,,,,,,"Aarts, E.H.L., Lenstra, J.K., (1997) Local Search in Combinatorial Optimization, , Wiley-Interscience Series in Discrete Mathematics and Optimization, ISBN 0-471-94822-5; Ahuja, R., Ergun, O., Orlin, J., Punnen, A., A Survey of very large-scale neighborhood search techniques (2002) Discrete Appl.

In particular, there is the difficulty in designing an appropriate genetic representation and intelligent genetic operators that are able to transfer the ordering characteristic of the parents to the offspring, while preserving the feasibility of the solution. In this research, we will experiment with a genetic encoding and operators specially designed to deal with the problem in hand. We will present a duplicate gene encoding that guarantees the satisfaction of the the precedence constraint, between the pickup and the delivery requests, throughout the search. We aim to show that GAs, if guided by some problem-specific information, will be able to handle this hard problem and possibly other similarly highly constrained problems.

This paper presents a productivity study about using three shorter, lighter trailers for moving household goods versus using one long, heavy trailer as commonly practised in the van-line industry. The conventional operations necessitate long delays due to loading and unloading. A goal of the proposed Shorter Trailer Combination Vehicles (STCV) operations is to maximise the operational efficiencies of long-haul trucks and the industry by dedicating such trucks to what they do best: moving, not waiting. A simulation approach is used to compare the performance of the conventional and STCV operations with respect to a stochastic Multi-Vehicle Pickup and Delivery Problem (MVPDP) in which the demand is random with random delivery due dates. The objective of the simulation is to determine the number of trucks and trailers, the pickup-and-delivery dispatch rule, and the type of transportation operations (conventional vs. STCV) that optimise various performance measures.

The first stage uses a simple simulated annealing algorithm to decrease the number of routes, while the second stage uses Large neighborhood search (LNS) to decrease total travel cost. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the algorithm which has produced many new best solutions on problems with 100, 200, and 600 customers. In particular, it has improved 47% and 76% of the best solutions on the 200 and 600-customer benchmarks, sometimes by as much as 3 vehicles. These results further confirm the benefits of two-stage approaches in vehicle routing. They also answer positively the open issue in the original LNS paper, which advocated the use of LNS for the PDPTW and argue for the robustness of LNS with respect to side-constraints. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",,"Algorithms; Computer operating systems; Problem solving; Scheduling; Simulated annealing; Large neighborhood search; Simulated annealing algorithms; Two-stage hybrid algorithms; Vehicle routing; Computer science",,,,,"DMI-01210495; ASEE, American Society for Engineering Education","We are grateful to the anonymous referees who helped in polishing the final presentation of this work.

Each request involves moving a number of goods from a pickup location to a delivery location. Our task is to construct routes that visit all locations such that corresponding pickups and deliveries are placed on the same route, and such that a pickup is performed before the corresponding delivery. The routes must also satisfy time window and capacity constraints. This paper presents a heuristic for the problem based on an extension of the large neighborhood search heuristic previously suggested for solving the vehicle routing problem with time windows. The proposed heuristic is composed of a number of competing subheuristics that are used with a frequency corresponding to their historic performance. This general framework is denoted adaptive large neighborhood search. The heuristic is tested on more than 350 benchmark instances with up to 500 requests. It is able to improve the best known solutions from the literature for more than 50% of the problems. The computational experiments indicate that it is advantageous to use several competing subheuristics instead of just one. We believe that the proposed heuristic is very robust and is able to adapt to various instance characteristics. © 2006 INFORMS.","Large neighborhood search; Metaheuristics; Pickup and delivery problems with time windows","Benchmarking; Computation theory; Constraint theory; Heuristic methods; Problem solving; Transportation routes; Delivery problems; Large neighborhood search; Metaheuristics; Pickup problems; Transportation",,,,,,,"Ahuja, R.K., Ergun, O., Orlin, J.B., Punnen, A.P., A survey of very large scale neighborhood search techniques (2002) Discrete Appl.

One of applications of ubiquitous and multi-agent systems is transportation system in urban area. While multi-agent and ubiquitous systems are considered to support next-generation social systems, it is not clear how it provides advantage in usability and benefit. We will show a result of comparison between dial-a-ride bus systems, one of possible multi-agent application of transportation systems, and traditional fixed-route bus systems. We conduct experiments of various situation and show how the advantage of dial-a-ride is robust to the variation of social conditions. For example, when many demands occur from/to a certain point like railway stations or shopping centers, improvement of usability of dial-a-ride systems is better than one of fixed-route systems so that a break-even point between the two systems is reduced. This means that dial-a-ride systems are useful even in 'rush-hour'. Through these experiments, we will figure out the conditions where multi-agent like systems have advantage against traditional systems. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.",,"Bus transportation; Cost benefit analysis; Robustness (control systems); Social sciences; Systems analysis; Dial-a-ride systems; Fixed-route bus systems; Scalability; Ubiquitous systems; Multi agent systems",,,,,,,"Bailey Jr., W.A., Clark Jr., T.D., A simulation analysis of demand and fleet size effects on taxicab service rates (1987) Proceedings of the 19th Conference on Winter Simulation, pp. 838-844. , [BC87].

Design/methodology/approach - First, a grouping genetic algorithm (GGA) for the (static) PDPTW is described. In order to solve the dynamic problem, the GGA then is embedded in a rolling horizon framework. Special updating mechanisms are provided which assure that reusable solution knowledge is preserved over the plan revisions. The approach is evaluated using a large number of test instances with varying degrees of dynamism. Findings - The experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed approach is able to find high-quality solutions when compared with two comparative heuristics. Research limitations/implications - Future research will be dedicated to the following issues: testing the proposed method using larger problem instances, using more sophisticated objective functions in order to further improve and evaluate the approach, integrating fast local search techniques into the genetic search, speeding up the algorithm by optimizing its implementation. Practical implications - In order to meet the increasing demands on the flexibility and the promptness of transportation services, algorithms are needed for dispatching transportation requests that arrive dynamically during the planning period. The findings of this contribution justify the employment of GAs in such dynamic transportation planning environments. Originality/value - Although the application of GAs in dynamic environments attracts growing attention, up to now no such algorithm has been published for the DPDPTW. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first time a GA has been applied to the DPDPTW. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Production scheduling; Programming and algorithm theory; Transport management",,,,,,,,"Bierwirth, C., (1999) Adaptive Search and the Management of Logistics Systems - Base Models for Learning Agents, , Kluwer, Boston, MA; Blanton, J.L., Wainwright, R.L., Multiple vehicle routing with time and capacity constraints using genetic algorithms (1993) Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Genetic Algorithms, pp. 452-459. , Forrest, S.

A set of jobs at dispersed locations requires teams of different types of workers where each job must be carried out in a preestablished time window and requires a specific length of time for completion. A job is satisfied if the required composite team can be brought together at the job's location for the required duration within the job's time window. The objective is to minimize a weighted sum of the total number of workers and the total traveling time. We show that construction heuristics used with simulated annealing is a good approach to solving this NP-hard problem.

Since it models several typical planning situations in operational transportation logistics and public transit, the PDPTW has attracted growing interest in recent years. This paper proposes a Grouping Genetic Algorithm (GGA) for solving the PDPTW which features a group-oriented genetic encoding in which each gene represents a group of requests instead of a single request. The GGA is subject to a comparative test on the basis of two publicly available benchmark problem sets that comprise 9 and 56 PDPTW instances, respectively. The results show that the proposed GGA is competitive. © Springer-Verlag 2005.","Genetic Algorithms; Group-oriented encoding; Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows",,,,,,,,"Berger, J., Salois, M., Begin, R., A hybrid genetic algorithm for the vehicle routing problem with time windows (1998) Advances in Artificial Intelligence - Proceedings of the 12th Biennial Conference of the Canadian Society for Computational Studies of Intelligence, pp. 114-127. , Mercer RE, Neufeld E (eds), Springer, Berlin Heidelberg New York; Blanton, J.L., Wainwright, R.L., Multiple vehicle routing with time and capacity constraints using genetic algorithms (1993) Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Genetic Algorithms, pp. 452-459. , Forrest S (ed), Morgan Kaufmann, San Mateo, CA; Bodin, L., Sexton, T., The multi-vehicle subscriber dial-a-ride problem (1986) TIMS Studies in the Management Sciences, 26, pp. 73-86; Davis, L., (1991) Handbook of Genetic Algorithms, , Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York; Desrochers, M., Desrosiers, J., Solomon, M.M., A new optimization algorithm for the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (1992) Operations Research, 40, pp. 342-354; Desrosiers, J., Dumas, Y., Soumis, F., A dynamic programming solution of the large-scale single-vehicle dial-a-ride problem with Time Windows (1986) The American Journal of Mathematical und Management Sciences, 6, pp. 301-325; Desrosiers, J., Dumas, Y., Soumis, F., The multiple vehicle dial-a-ride problem (1988) Computer-aided Transit Scheduling: Proceedings of the Fourth International Workshop on Computer-Aided Scheduling of Public Transport, pp. 15-27. , Daduna JR, Wren A (eds), Springer, Berlin Heidelberg New York; Dumas, Y., Desrosiers, J., Soumis, F., The Pickup und Delivery Problem with Time Windows (1991) European Journal of Operational Research, 54, pp. 7-22; Falkenauer, E., (1998) Genetic Algorithms und Grouping Problems, , Wiley, Chichester; Gendreau, M., Guertin, F., Potvin, J.Y., Séguin, R., (1998) Neighborhood Search Heuristics for a Dynamic Vehicle Dispatching Problem with Pick-ups und Deliveries, , Technical Report CRT-98-10, Centre de recherche sur les transports, Université de Montréal, Montréal; Goldberg, D.E., (1989) Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimization, und Machine Learning, , Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA; Goldberg, D.E., Korb, B., Deb, K., Messy genetic algorithms: Motivation, analysis, und first results (1990) Complex Systems, 3, pp. 493-530; Holland, J.H., (1975) Adaptation in Natural und Artificial Systems - An Introductory Analysis with Applications to Biology, Control, und Artificial Intelligence, , The University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor, MI; Homberger, J., (2000) Verteilt-parallele Metaheuristiken Zur Tourenplanung - Lösungsverfahren für Das Standardproblem Mit Zeitfensterrestriktionen, , Deutscher Universitäts-Verlag, Wiesbaden; Ioachim, I., Desrosiers, J., Dumas, Y., Solomon, M.M., Villeneuve, D., A request clustering algorithm for door-to-door handicapped transportation (1995) Transportation Science, 29, pp. 63-78; Jaw, J.J., Odoni, A.R., Psaraftis, H.N., Wilson, N.H.M., A heuristic algorithm for the Multi-Vehicle Advance Request Dial-A-Ride Problem with Time Windows (1986) Transportation Research Part B, 20, pp. 243-257; Jih, W.-R., Hsu, Y.-J., Dynamic Vehicle Routing Using Hybrid Genetic Algorithms (1999) Proceedings of the 1999 IEEE International Conference on Robotics & Automation, pp. 453-458. , IEEE Computer Society (ed), IEEE Computer Society, Los Alamitos, CA; Jung, S., Haghani, A., A Genetic Algorithm for Pick-up and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (2000) Transportation Research Record 1733, pp. 1-7. , Transportation Research Board; Kohl, N., Madsen, O.B.G., An Optimization Algorithm for the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows Based on Lagrangian Relaxation (1997) Operations Research, 45, pp. 395-406; Kopfer, H., Pankratz, G., Erkens, E., Die Entwicklung eines hybriden Genetischen Algorithmus für das Tourenplanungsproblem (1994) OR Spektrum, 16, pp. 21-32; Lau, H.C., Liang, Z., Pickup und Delivery with Time Windows, Algorithms und Test Case Generation (2001) Proceedings of the 13th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI), pp. 333-340. , IEEE Computer Society (ed), IEEE Computer Society, Los Alamitos, CA; Lenstra, J.K., Rinnoy Kan, A.H.G., Complexity of vehicle routing und scheduling problems (1981) Networks, 11, pp. 221-227; Li, H., Lim, A., A metaheuristic for solving the Pickup und Delivery Problem with Time Windows (2001) Proceedings of the 13th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI), pp. 160-167. , IEEE Computer Society (ed), IEEE Computer Society, Los Alamitos, CA; Lin, S., Kernighan, B., An effective heuristic algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem (1973) Operations Research, 21, pp. 498-516; Madsen, O.B.G., Ravn, H.F., Rygaard, J.M., A heuristic algorithm for a Dial-a-Ride Problem with Time Windows.

In some previous work, the conventional push forward insertion heuristic (PFIH) was successfully adapted to work with a new swap operator for repairs so as to effectively solve PDP-TWs. Here, we firstly adapted the PFIH to efficiently construct a better initial solution which will then be iteratively improved by another refined swapping scheme which systematically revises its neighborhood size for opportunistic improvements. The prototype using our refined heuristics gained impressive results against those of a tabu-embedded metaheuristic search on a set of modified Solomon's test cases.

Moreover, in case of a great deal of services and selling goods, a significant part of price is transport cost. Thus, the design of models and applications which make possible efficient transport planning and scheduling becomes important. A great deal of real transport problems may be modelled by using Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (PDPTW) and capacity constraints, which is based on the realization of a set of transport requests by a fleet of vehicles with given capacities. Each request is described by pickup and delivery locations, time periods when pickup and delivery operations should be performed and needed load. Application of evolutionary approach has brought good results in case of another, simpler transport problem - the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW). This paper is aimed at proposing a straightforward extension of VRPTW based heuristics for the PDPTW. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",,"Fleet operations; Pickups; Transportation; Capacity constraints; Evolutionary approach; Pickup and delivery; Pickup and delivery problem with time windows; Transport planning; Transport problems; Transport services; Vehicle routing problem with time windows; Vehicle routing",,,,,,,"(2003) Benchmarks - Vehicle Routing and Travelling Salesperson Problems, , http://www.sintef.no/static/am/opti/projects/top/vrp/benchmarks.html, Updated; 23 April; Braysy, O., Genetic Algorithms for the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (2001) Arpakanuus, 1. , special issue on Bioinformatics and Genetic Algorithms; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The Dial-a-Ride Problem: Variants, Modeling Issues and Algorithms (2002) Les Cahiers du CERAD; Desaulniers, G., Desrosiers, J., Erdmann, A., Solomon, M.M., Soumis, F., The VRP with Pickup and Delivery (2000) Les Cahiers du GERAD; Gendreau, A., Guertin, F., Potvin, J.Y., Séguin, R., Neighborhood search heuristics for a dynamic vehicle dispatching problem with pick-ups and deliveries (1998) Rapport Technique CRT-98-10, , Université de Montreal; Lau, H.C., Liang, Z., Pickup and Delivery with Time Windows: Algorithms and Test Case Generation (2001) Proceeedings of 13th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI'01), , Dallas, USA; Li, H., Lim, A., A Metaheuristic for the Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (2001) Proceedings of 13th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI'01), , Dallas, USA; Lim, H., Lim, A., Rodrigues, B., Solving the Pick up and Delivery Problem using ""Squeaky Wheel"" Optimization with Local Search (2002) Proceedings of American Conference on Information Systems, AMCIS 2002, , Dallas, USA; Madsen, O.B.G., Ravn, H.F., Rygaard, J.M., A heuristic algorithm for a dial-a-ride problem with time windows, multiple capacities, and multiple objectives (1995) Annals of Operations Research, 60, pp. 193-208; Mitrowic-Minic, S., Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (1998) A Survey.

A previous proposal successfully adapted and combined the well-known push forward insertion heuristic (PFIH) with a new repair-based swap operator as a computationally reduced version of the Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) to efficiently solve the PDP-TWs. In this paper, we focus on a more systematic scheme to adapt the LNS in order to effectively solve PDP-TWs. Up to our knowledge, this work represents the first attempt to systematically adapt LNS for solving PDP-TWs. Besides, the empirical results obtained by our search proposals affirmed the attractive capability of the LNS approach to effectively reduce the total distance traveled in solving PDP-TWs, with similar results also achieved by the original LNS method in tackling the conventional vehicle routing problems with time windows. Lastly, our proposal of adapting LNS to solve hard combinatorial problems opens up many possible directions for future investigations. © 2004 IEEE.",,"Heuristic search; Pickup and delivery problems with time windows (PDP-TW); Push forward insertion heuristic (PFIH); Vehicle routing problems (VRP); Constraint theory; Heuristic methods; Integer programming; Iterative methods; Optimization; Problem solving; Relaxation processes; Scheduling; Combinatorial mathematics",,,,,,,"Braysy, O., Genetic Algorithms for the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows.

For this reason, a software tool for rapid prototyping of algorithms would save considerable resources. This paper presents a generic software framework that reduces development time through abstract classes and software reuse, and more importantly, aids design with support of user-defined strategies and hybridization of meta-heuristics. Most interestingly, we propose a novel way of redefining hybridization with the use of the ""request and response"" metaphor, which form an abstract concept for hybridization. Different hybridization schemes can now be formed with minimal coding, which gives our proposed Meta-heuristics Development Framework its uniqueness. To illustrate the concept, we restrict to two popular meta-heuristics Ants Colony Optimization and Tabu Search, and demonstrate MDF through the implementation of various hybridized models to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem. © 2004 IEEE.",,"Ant colony optimization (ACO); Meta-heuristics; Rapid meta-heuristics hydridization; Tabu search (TS); Combinatorial mathematics; Computer software reusability; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Interfaces (computer); Java programming language; Object oriented programming; Problem solving; Traveling salesman problem; Software engineering",,,,,,,"Ahuja, R.K., Jha, K.C., Orlin, J.B., Sharma, D., Very large-scale neighborhood search for the quadratic assignment problem (2003) MIT Sloan School of Management Working Paper; Battiti, R., Tecchiolli, G., The reactive tabu search (1994) ORSA Journal on Computing, 6 (2), pp. 126-140; Bent, R., Van Hentenryck, P., A two stage hybrid local search for the vehicle routing problem with time windows (2001) Technical Report, CS-01-06. , Dept. of Computer Science, Brown University; Blum, C., Roli, A., Metaheuristics in combinatorial optimization: Overview and conceptual comparison (2003) ACM Computing Survey, 35 (3), pp. 268-308; Dorigo, M., Di Caro, G., (1999) The Ant Colony Optimization Meta-heuristic, pp. 11-32. , Readings, New Ideas in Optimization: McGraw-Hill; Fink, A., Voß, S., HotFrame: A heuristic optimization framework (2002) Optimization Software Class Libraries, pp. 81-154. , Readings: Kluwer, Boston; Di Gaspero, L., Schaerf, A., EASYLOCAL++: An object-oriented framework for the flexible design of local search algorithms and metaheuristics (2001) Proceedings of the 4th Metaheuristics International Conference; Glover, F., Laguna, M., (1997) Tabu Search, , Readings, Tabu Search: Kluwer Academic Publishers; Harder, R., (2001), http://opents.iharder.net, IBM OpenTS; Joslin, D.E., Clements, D.P., Squeaky wheel optimization (1999) Proceedings of the 15th American Association for Artificial Intelligence; Lau, H.C., Wan, W.C., Jia, X., Generic object-oriented tabu search framework (2003) Proceedings of the 5th Metaheuristics International Conference; Lau, H.C., Lim, M.K., Wan, W.C., Wang, H., Wu, X., Solving multi-objective multi-constrained optimization problems using hybrid ants system and tabu search (2003) Proceedings of the 5th Metaheuristics International Conference; Li, H., Lim, A., A metaheuristic for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2001) Proceedings of International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence; Michel, L., Van Hentenryck, P., Localizer++: An open library for local search (2001) Technical Report, CS-01-03. , Brown University; Parsopoulos, K.E., Vrahatis, M.N., Particle swarm optimization method for constrained optimization problems (2002) Intelligent Technologies - Theory and Applications: New Trends in Intelligent Technologies, pp. 214-220. , Readings: IOS Press; Reinelt, G., TSPLIB - A traveling salesman problem library (1991) ORSA Journal on Computing, 3, pp. 376-384; Rochat, Y., Taillard, E., Probabilistic diversification and intensification in local search for vehicle routing (1995) Journal of Heuristics, 1, pp. 147-167; Stützte, T., Dorigo, M., AGO algorithms for the traveling salesman Problem (1999) Evolutionary Algorithms in Engineering and Computer Science, , Readings, Wiley; Taillard, E., Robust tabu search for the quadratic assignment problem (1991) Parallel Computing, 17, pp. 443-455","Lau, H.C.; National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; email: lauhc@comp.nus.edu.sg",,,,"Proceedings of the 28th Annual International Computer Software and Applications Conference, COMPSAC 2004","28 September 2004 through 30 September 2004","Hong Kong, China",64717,07303157,,PSICD,,"English","Proc Int Comput Software Appl Conf",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-18744396368

While it has been reported that such systems improve the usability of bus systems when applied in a small town or area, it is not obvious how and under what conditions the systems are effective in comparison to traditional fixed-route bus systems. We conducted two computer simulations of dial-a-ride and fixed-route systems in order to compare the usability and profitability of both systems. Simulation results indicated that: (1) The usability of the dial-a-ride system with a fixed number of buses drops very quickly when the number of requests(demands) increases.

In this paper, we focus on which conditions and dial-a-ride systems(algorithms) are more efficient in urban areas, and for social systems as a whole.

The first stage uses a simple simulated annealing algorithm to decrease the number of routes, while the second stage uses LNS to decrease total travel cost. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the algorithm which has produced many new best solutions on problems with 100, 200, and 600 customers. In particular, it has improved 47% and 76% of the best solutions on the 200 and 600-customer benchmarks, sometimes by as much as 3 vehicles. These results further confirm the benefits of two-stage approaches in vehicle routing. They also answer positively the open issue in the original LNS paper, which advocated the use of LNS for the PDPTW and argue for the robustness of LNS with respect to side-constraints. © Springer-Verlag 2003.",,"Algorithms; Computer programming; Constraint theory; Hybrid vehicles; Network routing; Number theory; Pickups; Routing algorithms; Simulated annealing; Vehicles; Pickup and delivery; Side constraints; Simulated annealing algorithms; Time windows; Travel costs; Two stage approach; Two-stage hybrid algorithms; Vehicle routing",,,,,"DMI-01210495; ASEE, American Society for Engineering Education","We are grateful to the anonymous referees who helped in polishing the final presentation of this work.

Specifically, this problem originates from peculiar port yard scheduling needs where demand is generated from locations in the yard for servicemen who are dispatched from a central point and where the objectives are to minimize the number of servicemen scheduled, travel distances, travel times and waiting times at each location. Although closely related to the well-known vehicle routing problem, this problem is different while its solution could provide insight to the latter. We develop solutions using metaheuristic methods, and in particular provide tabu-embedded simulated annealing and squeaky wheel optimization with local search algorithms for this problem. We apply these newly-developed metaheuristics with adaptations for solutions to the manpower allocation problem, while our analysis throws light on how these work.

While it is reported that such systems improve usability of bus systems when applied in a small town or area, it is not obvious how and under what conditions the system are reasonable in comparison to traditional fixed-route bus systems. We conducted several computer simulations of dial-a-ride and fixed-route systems to compare usability and profitability of both systems. Simulation results indicated that: (1) Usability of the dial-a-ride system with a fixed number of buses drops very quickly when the number of demands increases. (2) When we increase the number of buses proportionally to the number of demands, the usability of the dial-a-ride system is improved more significantly than the fixed-route system.

While it is reported that such systems improve usability of bus systems when applied in a small town or area, it is not obvious how and under what conditions the system are reasonable in comparison to traditional fixed-route bus systems. We conducted several computer simulations of dial-a-ride and fixed-route systems to compare usability and profitability of both systems. Simulation results indicated that: (1) Usability of the dial-a-ride system with a fixed number of buses drops very quickly when the number of demands increases. (2) When we increase the number of buses proportionally to the number of demands, the usability of the dial-a-ride system is improved more significantly than the fixed-route system. (3) When frequency of demands is sufficiently large, the dial-a-ride system offers a reasonable solution from both usability and profitability perspectives. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.",,"Buses; Profitability; Urban transportation; Usability engineering; Bus systems; Dial-a-Ride; Dial-a-ride systems; Fixed numbers; Small towns; Social simulations; Transportation system; Urban areas; Multi agent systems",,,,,,,"Ascheuer, N., Krumke, S.O., Rambau, J., Online dial-a-ride problems: Minimizing the completion time (2000) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1770, pp. 639-650; Bailey, W.A., Jr., Clark, T.D., Jr., A simulation analysis of demand and fleet size effects on taxicab service rates (1987) Proceedings of the 19Th Conference on Winter Simulation, pp. 838-844. , ACM Press; Bodin, L.D., Golden, B.L., Assad, A., Ball, M.O., Routing and scheduling of vehicles and crews: The state of the art (1983) Computers and Operation Research, 10, pp. 63-211; Bianco, L., Mingozzi, A., Riccaiardelli, S., Spadoni, M., Exact and heuristic procedures for the traveling salesman problem with precedence constraints, based on dynamic programming (1994) INFOR, 32, pp. 19-31; Feuerstein, E., Stougie, L., On-line single-server dial-a-ride problems (2001) Theoretical Computer Science, 268 (1), pp. 91-105; Grotschel, M., Hauptmeier, D., Krumke, S., Rambau, J., (1999) Simulation Studies for the Online Dial-A-Ride-Problem; Grotschel, M., Krumke, S.O., Rambau, J., (2001) Online Optimization of Complex Transportation Systems; Haghani, A., Banihashemi, M., Heuristic approaches for solving large-scale bus transit vehicle scheduling problem with route time constraints Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice; Hauptmeier, D., Krumke, S.O., Rambau, J., The online dial-a-ride problem under reasonable load (2000) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1767, pp. 125-133; Hauptmeier, D., Krumke, S.O., Rambau, J., Wirth, H.-C., Euler is standing in line dial-a-ride problems with precedence-constraints (2001) Discrete Applied Mathematics, 113 (1), pp. 87-107; Healy, P., Moll, R., A new extension of local search applied to the dial-a-ride problem (1995) European Journal of Operations Research, 83, pp. 83-104; Horn, M., Multi-modal and demand-responsive passenger transport systems: A modelling framework with embedded control systems (2002) Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 36 (2), pp. 167-188; Krumke, S.O., De Paepe, W.E., Poensgen, D., Stougie, L., News from the online traveling repairman Lecture Notes in Computer Science, p. 2136; Li, H., Lim, A., A metaheuristic for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2001) IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence, 13, pp. 160-167; Maarten Lipmann, X.L., De Paepe, W.E., Sitters, R.A., Stougie, L., On-line dial-a-ride problems under a restricted information model (2002) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2461, pp. 674-685; Psarfaits, H.N., A dynamic programming solution to the single vehicle many-to-many immediate request dial-a-ride problem (1980) Transportation Science, 14, pp. 135-154; Psarfaits, H.N., A exact algorithm for the single vehicle many-to-many dial-a-ride problem with time windows (1983) Transportation Science, 17, pp. 315-357; Psarfatis, H.N., Analysis of an o(N2) heuristic for the single vehicle manyto-many euclidean dial-a-ride problem (1983) Transportation Research, pp. 133-145; Ruland, K.S., Rodin, E.Y., The pickup and delivery problem: Faces and branch-and-cut algorithm (1997) Computers Math.
