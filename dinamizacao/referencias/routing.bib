	abstract = {This paper presents an analytic model to predict average waiting and ridingtimes in urban transportation systems (such as dial-a-bus and taxicabs), which provide non-transfer door-to-door transportation with a dynamically dispatched fleet of vehicles. Three different dispatching algorithms are analyzed with a simple deterministic model, which is then generalized to capture the most relevant stochastic phenomena. The formulae obtained have been successfully compared with simulated data and are simple enough for hand calculation. They are, thus, tools which enable analysts to avoid cumbersome simulation models when contemplating implementing or modifying many-to-many demand responsive transportation systems.},

	abstract = {An investigation of the single-vehicle, many-to-many, immediate-request dial-a-ride problem is developed in two parts (I and II). Part I focuses on the “static” case of the problem. In this case, intermediate requests that may appear during the execution of the route are not considered. A generalized objective function is examined, the minimization of a weighted combination of the time to service all customers and of the total degree of “dissatisfaction” experienced by them while waiting for service. This dissatisfaction is assumed to be a linear function of the waiting and riding times of each customer. Vehicle capacity constraints and special priority rules are part of the problem. A Dynamic Programming approach is developed. The algorithm exhibits a computational effort which, although an exponential function of the size of the problem, is asymptotically lower than the corresponding effort of the classical Dynamic Programming algorithm applied to a Traveling Salesman Problem of the same size. Part II extends this approach to solving the equivalent “dynamic” case. In this case, new customer requests are automatically eligible for consideration at the time they occur. The procedure is an open-ended sequence of updates, each following every new customer request. The algorithm optimizes only over known inputs and does not anticipate future customer requests. Indefinite deferment of a customer’s request is prevented by the priority rules introduced in Part I. Examples in both “static” and “dynamic” cases are presented.},

The time constraints consist of upper bounds on: (1) the amount of time by which the pick-up or delivery of a customer can deviate from the desired pick-up or delivery time; (2) the time that a customer can spend riding in a vehicle. The algorithm uses a sequential insertion procedure to assign customers to vehicles and to determine a time schedule of pick-ups and deliveries for each vehicle. A flexible objective function balances the cost of providing service with the customers' preferences for pick-up and delivery times close to those requested, and for short ride times. Computational experience with the algorithm is described, including a run with a real database of 2600 customers and some 20 simultaneously active vehicles.

Bertsimas and G. van Ryzin introduced and analyzed a model for stochastic and dynamic vehicle routing in which a single, uncapacitated vehicle traveling at a constant velocity in a Euclidean region must service demands whose time of arrival, location and on-site service are stochastic. The objective is to find a policy to service demands over an infinite horizon that minimizes the expected system time (wait plus service) of the demands. This paper extends our analysis in several directions. First, we analyze the problem of m identical vehicles with unlimited capacity and show that in heavy traffic the system time is reduced by a factor of 1/m2 over the single-server case. One of these policies improves by a factor of two on the best known system time for the single-server case. We then consider the case in which each vehicle can serve at most q customers before returning to a depot. We show that the stability condition in this case depends strongly on the geometry of the region. Several policies that have system times within a constant factor of the optimum in heavy traffic are proposed. Finally, we discuss extensions to mixed travel cost and system time objectives.},

Here, “fully automated” means that under normal operation, the customer is the only human involved in the entire process of requesting a ride, assigning trips, scheduling arrivals and routing the vehicle. There are no telephone operators to receive calls, nor any central dispatchers to assign trips to vehicles, nor any human planning a route. The vehicles' computers assign trip demands and plan routes optimally among themselves, and the drivers' only job is to obey instructions from their vehicle's computer. Consequently, an ADART vehicle fleet covers a large service area without any centralized supervision. In effect, the vehicles behave like a swarm of ants accomplishing their chore without anyone in charge.},

The CFFS needed a new system for scheduling elderly and disabled persons, involving about 50.000 requests per year. The problem is characterized by, among other things, multiple capacities and multiple objectives. The capacities refer to the fact that a vehicle may be equipped with e.g. normal seats, children seats or wheel chair places. The objectives relate to a number of concerns such as e.g. short driving time, high vehicle utilization or low costs. A solution algorithm REBUS based on an insertion heuristics was developed. The algorithm permits in a flexible way weighting of the various goals such that the solution reflects the user's preferences. The algorithm is implemented in a dynamic environment intended for on-line scheduling. Thus, a new request for service is treated in less than 1 second, permitting an interactive user interface.},

Our objective is to maximize the probability that the additional customer can be integrated into one of the otherwise fixed tours without violating time constraints. This is achieved by letting the vehicles wait at suitable locations during their tours, thus influencing the position of the vehicles at the time when the new customer arrives. For the cases of one and two vehicles, we derive theoretical results about the best waiting strategies. The general problem is shown to be NP-complete. Several deterministic waiting strategies and an evolutionary algorithm to optimize the waiting strategy are proposed and compared empirically. It is demonstrated that a proper waiting strategy can significantly increase the probability of being able to service the additional customer, at the same time reducing the average detour to serve that customer.},

For this problem, we have developed a two-phase insertion algorithm based on route perturbations: the first phase, which is run off-line when the vehicle moves between two successive stops, aims at creating a feasible neighborhood of the current route; while the second phase, which is run in real-time every time a new request occurs, inserts, when possible, the delivery stop of the new customer in the current route.},

Experimental results show that waiting and relocation strategies may dramatically improve customer service, especially for problems that are highly dynamic and contain many late requests.

In this study, the strategies are tested in a constructive-deconstructive heuristic for the dynamic pickup and delivery problem with hard time windows and random travel times.

A fast heuristic is proposed to re-optimize the schedule when a new event occurs. This heuristic consists of a properly organized local search strategy and uses a secondary objective function to drive the search out of local optima. Intensive computational simulations were carried out to evaluate the performance of this scheduling scheme and the influence of different stochastic factors. The simulation results of different scenarios with different percentage of dynamic requests reveal that this scheduling scheme can generate high quality schedules and is capable of coping with various stochastic events.},

Depending on the hospital layout, transportation between nursing wards and service units is either provided by ambulances or by trained personnel who accompany patients on foot. In many large German hospitals, the patient transport service is poorly managed and lacks work-flow coordination. This contributes to higher hospital costs (e.g., because a patient is not delivered to the operating room on time) and to patient inconvenience (e.g., because of long waiting times). We designed a computer-based planning system, Opti-TRANS©, that supports all phases of the transportation flow, including travel booking, dispatching transport requests, and monitoring and reporting trips in real time. The methodology, which we developed to solve the underlying optimization problem—a dynamic dial-a-ride problem with hospital-specific constraints, draws on fast heuristic methods to ensure the efficient and timely provision of transports. We illustrate the strong impact of Opti-TRANS on the daily performance of the patient transportation service of a large German hospital. The major benefits of Opti-TRANS include streamlined transportation processes and work flow, significant savings, and improved patient satisfaction. Moreover, it has contributed to increased awareness among hospital staff of the importance of implementing efficient logistics practices.},

	abstract = {The problem studied in this paper stems from a real application to the transportation of patients in the Hospital Complex of Tours (France). The ambulance central station of the Hospital Complex has to plan the transportation demands between care units which require a vehicle. Some demands are known in advance and the others arise dynamically. Each demand requires a specific type of vehicle and a vehicle can transport only one person at a time. The demands can be subcontracted to a private company which implies high cost. Moreover, transportations are subject to particular constraints, among them priority of urgent demands, disinfection of a vehicle after the transportation of a patient with contagious disease and respect of the type of vehicle needed. These characteristics involve a distinction between the vehicles and the crews during the modeling phase. We propose a modeling for solving this difficult problem and a tabu search algorithm inspired by Gendreau et al. (1999). This method supports an adaptive memory and a tabu search procedure. Computational experiments on a real-life instance and on randomly generated instances show that the method can provide high-quality solutions for this dynamic problem with a short computation time.},

	abstract = {The problem of transporting patients or elderly people has been widely studied in literature and is usually modeled as a dial-a-ride problem (DARP). In this paper we analyze the corresponding problem arising in the daily operation of the Austrian Red Cross. This nongovernmental organization is the largest organization performing patient transportation in Austria. The aim is to design vehicle routes to serve partially dynamic transportation requests using a fixed vehicle fleet. Each request requires transportation from a patient's home location to a hospital (outbound request) or back home from the hospital (inbound request). Some of these requests are known in advance. Some requests are dynamic in the sense that they appear during the day without any prior information. Finally, some inbound requests are stochastic. More precisely, with a certain probability each outbound request causes a corresponding inbound request on the same day. Some stochastic information about these return transports is available from historical data. The purpose of this study is to investigate, whether using this information in designing the routes has a significant positive effect on the solution quality. The problem is modeled as a dynamic stochastic dial-a-ride problem with expected return transports. We propose four different modifications of metaheuristic solution approaches for this problem. In detail, we test dynamic versions of variable neighborhood search (VNS) and stochastic VNS (S-VNS) as well as modified versions of the multiple plan approach (MPA) and the multiple scenario approach (MSA). Tests are performed using 12 sets of test instances based on a real road network. Various demand scenarios are generated based on the available real data. Results show that using the stochastic information on return transports leads to average improvements of around 15\%. Moreover, improvements of up to 41\% can be achieved for some test instances.},

All of these features originate from practical applications in recent years. To formulate the problem, we propose two mathematical models that use different methods to deal with requests associated with the depot. To further strengthen the models, we propose eight families of valid inequalities, and based on them, we propose a branch-and-cut algorithm to solve the problem. The branch-and-cut algorithm was extensively tested on a set of instances generated according to the data of a real world application. The computational results showed that seven families of inequalities can improve the lower bounds substantially and the branch-and-cut algorithm can solve instances with up to 22 requests within 4 h. Highlights • Introduced a more realistic variant of the dial-a-ride problem. • Formulated the problem into two models. • Proposed eight families of valid inequalities to strengthen the models. • Devised a branch-and-cut algorithm to solve the problem. • The branch-and-cut algorithm optimally solved instances with up to 22 requests.},

	abstract = {Multi-constrained Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) are gaining in interest. Due to technology advancement, especially the stochastic character of real world VRP's obtains more emphasis within the solution finding process. Besides the multi scenario approach, simulation-based optimization addresses the randomness, and is proposed as a solving method. In this paper, we present a short review of existing open-source Rich VRP (RVRP) models. We introduce a RVRP Simulation Model and its corresponding Discrete Event Simulator. It is used to evaluate routing solution candidates for metaheuristic-driven optimization frameworks. Our implementation is published under an open source license in a public repository. We demonstrate the integration of our RVRP Simulator with the general purpose metaheuristic optimization framework SEREIN and show the feasibility of our approach by applying it to well-known Capacitated VRP instances.},

	abstract = {The rapid development of automated vehicles and the introduction of shared mobility services hold great potential for the development of automated public transport systems. However, their expected performance under alternative conditions and with alternative design factors remains unknown. In this study, the operation of a new automated mobility service was simulated and evaluated. The proposed transport system was defined as an automated demand-responsive transport system (ADRTS), which consisted of a demand-responsive public transportation service providing sharable rides without fixed routes or timetables in automated vehicles. Requests for the ADRTS were combined if they shared the same pickup and drop-off locations, subject to vehicle capacity limitations. Rides were launched within a predefined maximum vehicle dwell time, and routes were chosen without detours. The proposed system was tested in a field operation pilot project of the operation of automated vehicles in Wageningen in the Netherlands under conditions with different demand patterns, vehicle capacities, and operational factors. The simulation model determined the minimal and optimal fleet size for operation of the shuttle service when total operational and travel costs were minimized and maximum passenger waiting time requirements were satisfied. The results indicated that the most effective way to reduce the system cost per passenger of the ADRTS in the presented case study was to increase the demand level, increase the share of passengers who arrive independently, and use adequate vehicle sizes and short vehicle dwell times.},

	abstract = {This paper advocates a new paradigm of transportation systems for future smart cities, namely, public vehicles (PVs), that provides dynamic ridesharing trips at requests. Passengers will enjoy more convenient and flexible transportation services with much less expense. In the PV system, both the number of vehicles and required parking spaces will be significantly reduced. There will be less traffic congestion, less energy consumption, and less pollution. In this paper, the concept, method, and algorithm for the PV system are described. The key issue of effectively implementing the PV system is to design efficient planning and scheduling algorithms. The PV-path problem is formulated, which is NP-complete. Then, a practical approach is proposed, which can serve people anywhere and anytime. The simulation results show that, to achieve the same performance (e.g., total time, waiting time, and travel time), the number of vehicles in the PV system can be reduced by around 90\% and 57\% compared with the conventional vehicle system and Uber Pool, respectively, and the total traveling distance can be reduced by 34\% and 14\%.},

User inconvenience can either be limited by constraints or it can be considered in the objective function.

These are (1) type of problem, (2) logistical context, (3) transportation mode, (4) objective function, (5) fleet size, (6) time constraints, (7) vehicle capacity constraints, (8) the ability to reject customers, (9) the nature of the dynamic element, (10) the nature of the stochasticity (if any), and (11) the solution method. We comment on technological vis‐à‐vis methodological advances for this class of problems and suggest directions for further research. The latter include alternative objective functions, vehicle speed as decision variable, more explicit linkages of methodology to technological advances and analysis of worst case or average case performance of heuristics. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We first study algorithms for the online Traveling Repairman Problem (TRP), where a single server is to visit a set of locations in a network with the objective of minimizing the sum of weighted completion times. We then analyze well‐known online algorithms for a variety of machine scheduling problems, which are appropriate models for many network optimization problems; in the scheduling notation of Graham et al. 18, we consider 1{\textbar}rj,pmtn{\textbar}∑jwjCj, 1{\textbar}rj{\textbar}∑jwjCj, Q{\textbar}rj,pmtn{\textbar}∑jCj, P{\textbar}rj{\textbar}∑jCj, Q{\textbar}rj,pmtn{\textbar}∑jwjCj and Q{\textbar}rj{\textbar}∑jwjCj. We introduce general probabilistic assumptions about the problem data as a tool to study the online algorithms for these online combinatorial problems.

Our three-dimensional state–space–time network construct is able to comprehensively enumerate possible transportation states at any given time along vehicle space–time paths, and further allows a forward dynamic programming solution algorithm to solve the single vehicle VRPPDTW problem. By utilizing a Lagrangian relaxation approach, the primal multi-vehicle routing problem is decomposed to a sequence of single vehicle routing sub-problems, with Lagrangian multipliers for individual passengers’ requests being updated by sub-gradient-based algorithms. We further discuss a number of search space reduction strategies and test our algorithms, implemented through a specialized program in C++, on medium-scale and large-scale transportation networks, namely the Chicago sketch and Phoenix regional networks.},

For this matter we use a dedicated and greedy heuristic which entry is a workday made of a sequence of trips. Moreover, a break may have a shorter duration than the existing interval between trips. Finally, we show that this algorithm is fast and able to generate valid and efﬁcient workdays.},

In practical applications, these methods often were key elements for the viability of this optimization approach. The research cited here shows their use led to computational gains, and notably to solutions that could not have been obtained otherwise due to practical problem complexity and size. In particular, we present recent methods directed at the integer programming aspect of the approach that were instrumental in substantially reducing the integrality gap found in certain applications, thereby helping to efficiently produce excellent quality solutions.},

CREW-OPT produces optimal or near-optimal crew schedules for small problems (usually a single bus line or a small transit operation.) It is based on the resolution of a set covering formulation of the crew scheduling problem. Each row of the set covering problem corresponds to a task to perform and each column to a feasible workday. The objective is to construct a minimum cost set of workdays which covers all of the tasks. As the number of columns in this formulation is very large, we use a column generation approach to solve it. As is generally the case with column generation, the cornerstone of the approach is the design of an appropriate subproblem to generate proposed columns for the master problem. In this paper, we discuss the art of modeling such subproblems using a model of the constrained shortest path type.},

	abstract = {This paper is the first part of a comprehensive survey on pickup and delivery problems. Basically, two problem classes can be distinguished. The first class, discussed in this paper, deals with the transportation of goods from the depot to linehaul customers and from backhaul customers to the depot. This class is denoted as Vehicle Routing Problems with Backhauls (VRPB). Four subtypes can be considered, namely the Vehicle Routing Problem with Clustered Backhauls (VRPCB – all linehauls before backhauls), the Vehicle Routing Problem with Mixed linehauls and Backhauls (VRPMB – any sequence of linehauls and backhauls permitted), the Vehicle Routing Problem with Divisible Delivery and Pickup (VRPDDP – customers demanding delivery and pickup service can be visited twice), and the Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Delivery and Pickup (VRPSDP – customers demanding both services have to be visited exactly once). The second class, dealt with in the second part of this survey, refers to all those problems where goods are transported between pickup and delivery locations. These are the Pickup and Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem (PDVRP – unpaired pickup and delivery points), the classical Pickup and Delivery Problem (PDP – paired pickup and delivery points), and the Dial-A-Ride Problem (DARP – passenger transportation between paired pickup and delivery points and user inconvenience taken into consideration). Single as well as multi vehicle versions of the mathematical problem formulations are given for all four VRPB types, the corresponding exact, heuristic, and metaheuristic solution methods are discussed.},
