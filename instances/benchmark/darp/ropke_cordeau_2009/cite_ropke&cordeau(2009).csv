At an operational level, it is important to fully utilize and coordinate technicians in order to increase efficiency of the short-term maintenance planning. In this paper, we investigate sharing of technicians between wind farms over multiple periods, while determining per period vessel routes for delivering and picking up technicians. The problem can be considered as a novel variant of the multi-period multi-commodity pickup and delivery problem. We develop an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search heuristic which achieves high-quality, and often optimal, solutions on benchmark instances from the literature. The heuristic is used to explore the benefits of different sharing policies. By sharing technicians, both the flexibility of the daily planning is improved and the expected maintenance costs are reduced. In addition, the increased flexibility results in fewer vessel trips and increases the decision maker's ability to cope with extreme scenarios encountered in the short-term maintenance planning. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search; Maintenance routing; Offshore wind; Pickup and delivery; Resource sharing","Benchmarking; Decision making; Electric utilities; Heuristic algorithms; Maintenance; Optimization; Pickups; Planning; Adaptive large neighborhood searches; Maintenance routing; Offshore winds; Pickup and delivery; Resource sharing; Offshore wind farms",,,,,"Alinaghian, M., Shokouhi, N., Multi-depot multi-compartment vehicle routing problem, solved by a hybrid adaptive large neighborhood search (2018) Omega, 76, pp. 85-99; Baldacci, R., Bartolini, E., Mingozzi, A., An exact algorithm for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2011) Oper.

This variant is an extension of well-known pick up and delivery problem (PDP) where a fleet of vehicles must satisfy a given number of transportation requests subject to many constraints. We include the multi-period aspect to our variant to match real-world applications where sites can be visited by a vehicle in one or several periods. In this study, we aim at minimizing simultaneously the total traveled distance needed for vehicles to satisfy all requests and the penalty involved by serving a site lately.

A request is composed of several pickups of different items, followed by a single delivery at the client location. We formally describe, model and solve this rich and new problem in the field of pickup and delivery vehicle routing. We solve the problem exactly via branch-and-bound and heuristically developing a hybrid adaptive large neighborhood search with improvement operations. Several new removal and insertion operators are developed to tackle the special precedence constraints, which can be used in other pickup and delivery problems. Computational results are reported on different types of instances to study the performance of the developed algorithms, highlighting the performance of our heuristic compared to the exact method, and assessing its sensibility to different parameter settings. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Multi-pickup and delivery problem; Sequential ordering problem; Vehicle routing problem","Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Optimization; Pickups; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Adaptive large neighborhood searches; Computational results; Pickup and delivery; Pickup and delivery problem with time windows; Pickup and delivery problems; Precedence constraints; Sequential ordering problems; Vehicle Routing Problems; Problem solving",,,,,"Ai, T.J., Kachitvichyanukul, V., A particle swarm optimization for the vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickup and delivery (2009) Computers & Operations Research, 36 (5), pp. 1693-1702; Alonso-Ayuso, A., Detti, P., Escudero, L.F., Ortuño, M.T., On dual based lower bounds for the sequential ordering problem with precedences and due dates (2003) Annals of Operations Research, 124 (1-4), pp. 111-131; Ascheuer, N., Jünger, M., Reinelt, G., A branch & cut algorithm for the asymmetric traveling salesman problem with precedence constraints (2000) Computational Optimization and Applications, 17 (1), pp. 61-84; Balas, E., Fischetti, M., Pulleyblank, W.R., The precedence-constrained asymmetric traveling salesman polytope (1995) Mathematical Programming, 68 (1-3), pp. 241-265; Baldacci, R., Bartolini, E., Mingozzi, A., An exact algorithm for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2011) Operations Research, 59 (2), pp. 414-426; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Gribkovskaia, I., Laporte, G., Static pickup and delivery problems: A classification scheme and survey (2007) Top, 15 (1), pp. 1-31; Bortfeldt, A., Hahn, T., Männel, D., Mönch, L., Hybrid algorithms for the vehicle routing problem with clustered backhauls and 3d loading constraints (2015) European Journal of Operational Research, 243 (1), pp. 82-96; Coelho, L., Renaud, J., Laporte, G., Road-based goods transportation: a survey of real-world logistics applications from 2000 to 2015 (2016) INFOR: Information Systems and Operational Research, 54 (2), pp. 79-96; Coelho, L.C., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Consistency in multi-vehicle inventory-routing (2012) Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 24 (1), pp. 270-287; Coelho, L.C., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The inventory-routing problem with transshipment (2012) Computers & Operations Research, 39 (11), pp. 2537-2548; Desaulniers, G., Desrosiers, J., Erdmann, A., Solomon, M.M., Soumis, F., VRP with pickup and delivery (2001) The vehicle routing problem, pp. 225-242. , P.

To a high degree these needs can be fulfilled by individual and public transport. People that do not have access to the former and cannot use the latter require additional means of transportation. This is where dial-a-ride services come into play. The dial-a-ride problem considers transportation requests of people from pick-up to drop-off locations. Users specify time windows with respect to these points. Requests are served by a given vehicle fleet with limited capacity and tour duration per vehicle. Moreover, user inconvenience considerations are taken into account by limiting the travel time between origin and destination for each request. Previous research on the dial-a-ride problem primarily focused on serving a given set of requests with a fixed-size vehicle fleet at minimal traveling costs. It is assumed that the request set is sufficiently small to be served by the available vehicles. We consider a different scenario in which a maximal number of requests shall be served under the given constraints, i.e., it is no longer guaranteed that all requests can be accepted. For this new problem variant we propose a compact mixed integer linear programming model as well as algorithms based on Benders decomposition. In particular, we employ logic-based Benders decomposition and branch-and-check using mixed integer linear programming and constraint programming algorithms. We consider different variants on how to generate Benders cuts as well as heuristic boosting techniques and different types of valid inequalities. Computational experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the suggested algorithms. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Branch-and-check; Combinatorial Benders cuts; Dial-a-Ride problem; Logic-based Benders decomposition; Transportation","Computation theory; Computer circuits; Computer programming; Constraint theory; Fleet operations; Stochastic programming; Transportation; Travel time; Vehicles; Branch-and-check; Combinatorial Benders cuts; Computational experiment; Dial-a-ride problem; Logic-based benders decompositions; Means of transportations; Mixed integer linear programming; Mixed integer linear programming model; Integer programming",,,,,"Baklagis, D.G., Dikas, G., Minis, I., The team orienteering pick-up and delivery problem with time windows and its applications in fleet sizing (2016) RAIRO-Oper.

One conceivable scenario of using a drone in conjunction with a traditional delivery truck to distribute parcels is discussed in earlier literature and termed the parallel drone scheduling traveling salesman problem (PDSTSP). This study extends the problem by considering two different types of drone tasks: drop and pickup. After a drone completes a drop, the drone can either fly back to depot to deliver the next parcels or fly directly to another customer for pickup. Integrated scheduling of multiple depots hosting a fleet of trucks and a fleet of drones is further studied to achieve an operational excellence. A vehicle that travels near the boundary of the coverage area might be more effective to serve customers that belong to the neighboring depot. This problem is uniquely modeled as an unrelated parallel machine scheduling with sequence dependent setup, precedence-relationship, and reentrant, which gives us a framework to effectively consider those operational challenges. A constraint programming approach is proposed and tested with problem instances of m-truck, m-drone, m-depot, and hundred-customer distributed across an 8-mile square region. © 2018","Constraint programming; Traveling salesman problem; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Vehicle routing problem","Antennas; Computer programming; Constraint theory; Drones; Drops; Fleet operations; Optimization; Pickups; Sales; Scheduling; Trucks; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vehicle routing; Constraint programming; Integrated scheduling; Operational challenges; Operational excellence; Precedence relationships; Sequence dependent setups; Unrelated parallel machines; Vehicle Routing Problems; Traveling salesman problem; aircraft; distribution system; logistics; operations technology; unmanned vehicle",,,,,"Agatz, N., Bouman, P., Schmidt, M., (2016), Optimization Approaches for the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drone; Baptiste, P., Le Pape, C., Nuijten, W., Constraint-Based Scheduling: Applying Constraint Programming to Scheduling Problems (2012), Springer Science & Business Media; Beck, J.C., Prosser, P., Wallace, R.J., Variable ordering heuristics show promise (2004) International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming, pp. 711-715. , Springer, Berlin Heidelberg; Berg, P.W., Isaacs, S., Blodgett, K.L., (2016), Amazon Technologies Inc.

We apply three well-established exact solution approaches and compare their performance in terms of computational time. To avoid unrealistic solutions with unevenly distributed workload, we extend the problem by introducing minimum workload constraints. Our computational results show that, while for the original problem Benders decomposition is the method of choice, for the newly formulated problem this method is clearly dominated by the proposed column generation approach.

In this new variant of the dial-a-ride problem, en-route modifications of the vehicle's inner configuration are allowed. The main consequence is that the vehicle capacity is defined by a set of configurations and the choice of vehicle configuration is associated with binary decision variables. The problem is modeled as a mixed-integer program derived from the model of the heterogeneous dial-a-ride problem. Vehicle reconfiguration is a lever to efficiently reduce transportation costs, but the number of passengers and vehicle fleet setting make this problem intractable for exact solution methods. A large neighborhood search metaheuristic combined with a set covering component with a reactive mechanism to automatically adjust its parameters is therefore proposed. The resulting framework is evaluated against benchmarks from the literature, used for similar routing problems. It is also applied to a real case, in the context of the transportation of disabled children from their home to medical centers in the city of Lyon, France. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Dial-a-ride problem; Feasibility check; Fleet size and mix problem; Heterogeneous fleet; Large neighborhood search; Reconfigurable vehicles; Set-covering","Integer programming; Vehicles; Dial-a-ride problem; Feasibility check; Fleet size and mixes; Heterogeneous fleet; Large neighborhood search; Reconfigurable; Set coverings; Fleet operations; cost analysis; decision making; disability; technology adoption; transportation technology; travel behavior; Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes; France; Grand Lyon; Lyons",,,,,"Archetti, C., Speranza, M.G., A survey on matheuristics for routing problems (2014) EURO J.

We formulate this problem into a mixed integer linear programming model, which can be viewed as a combination of the capacitated VRP, the multi-depot VRP, the open VRP and the pickup-and-delivery problem with time windows (PDPTW). To solve the LMDP, we develop a meta-heuristic algorithm based on iterated local search, in which an adaptive large neighborhood search is applied in the perturbation phase to enlarge the search scope. Results from the computational experiments show that the proposed approach performs well when applied to the benchmark instances. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by applying it to some real cases of the LMDP. © 2018 IEEE.","iterated local search; Last mile delivery; pickup-and-delivery; time windows; vehicle routing","Benchmarking; Heuristic algorithms; Integer programming; Local search (optimization); Pickups; Adaptive large neighborhood searches; Computational experiment; Iterated local search; Last mile; Mixed integer linear programming model; Pickup and delivery; Pickup and delivery problem with time windows; Time windows; Vehicle routing",,,,,"Ben Alaa, E., Harbaoui Dridi, I., Bouchriha, H., Borne, P., Insertion of new depot locations for the optimization of multi-vehicles multi-depots pickup and delivery problems using genetic algorithm (2016) International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Systems Management, pp. 695-701; Blocho, M., Nalepa, J., Lcs-based selective route exchange crossover for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2017) European Conference on Evolutionary Computation in Combinatorial Optimization, pp. 124-140. , Springer; Derigs, U., Reuter, K., A simple and efficient tabu search heuristic for solving the open vehicle routing problem (2009) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 60 (12), pp. 1658-1669; Hosny, M.I., Mumford, C.L., Constructing initial solutions for the multiple vehicle pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2012) Journal of King Saud University-Computer and Information Sciences, 24 (1), pp. 59-69; Li, H., Lim, A., A metaheuristic for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2003) International Journal on Artificial Intelligence Tools, 12 (2), pp. 173-186; Liu, R., Jiang, Z., Geng, N., A hybrid genetic algorithm for the multi-depot open vehicle routing problem (2014) Or Spectrum, 36 (2), pp. 423-424; Lourenço, H.R., Martin, O.C., Stützle, T., Iterated local search (2003) Handbook of Metaheuristics, pp. 320-353. , Springer; Nagata, Y., Kobayashi, S., Guided ejection search for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2010) European Conference on Evolutionary Computation in Combinatorial Optimization, pp. 202-213; Pisinger, D., Ropke, S., A general heuristic for vehicle routing problems (2007) Computers and Operations Research, 34 (8), pp. 2403-2435; Qu, Y., Bard, J.F., A grasp with adaptive large neighborhood search for pickup and delivery problems with transshipment (2012) Computers & Operations Research, 39 (10), pp. 2439-2456; Reinholz, A., Schneider, H., A hybrid (1+1)-evolutionary strategy for the open vehicle routing problem (2013) Advances in Metaheuristics, pp. 127-141. , Springer; Repoussis, P.P., Tarantilis, C.D., Bräysy, O., Ioannou, G., A hybrid evolution strategy for the open vehicle routing problem (2010) Computers & Operations Research, 37 (3), pp. 443-455; Ropke, S., Cordeau, J., Branch and cut and price for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2009) Transportation Science, 43 (3), pp. 267-286; Sombuntham, P., Kachitvichayanukul, V., A particle swarm optimization algorithm for multi-depot vehicle routing problem with pickup and delivery requests (2010) Lecture Notes in Engineering and Computer Science, 2182 (1), pp. 965-972; Tarantilis, C.D., Kiranoudis, C.T., A list-based threshold accepting method for job shop scheduling problems (2002) International Journal of Production Economics, 77 (2), pp. 159-171","Zhang, Z.; School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-Sen UniversityChina; email: zhangzzh7@mail.sysu.edu.cn",,"","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","15th IEEE International Conference on Networking, Sensing and Control, ICNSC 2018","27 March 2018 through 29 March 2018",,136605,,9781538650530,,,"English","ICNSC - IEEE Int.

While being transported, items are stored in stacks with limited capacity. Each stack must follow the Last-In-First-Out policy. The objective of the problem is to find a vehicle route that fulfills all requests and minimizes traveled distance. In this paper, we propose new integer programming formulations to the problem along with ad hoc branch-and-cut algorithms and valid inequalities. The formulations and algorithms are applied to benchmark instances and the computational results are compared with the literature. Instances for which an optimal solution was previously known in the literature are solved more efficiently in this work. Also, new optimality certificates are provided for seven instances. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Branch-and-cut; Loading constraints; Multiple stacks; Pickup and delivery; Traveling salesman","Benchmarking; Integer programming; Pickups; Vehicle routing; Branch and cut; Loading constraints; Multiple stacks; Pickup and delivery; Traveling salesman; Traveling salesman problem",,,,,"Balas, E., Fischetti, M., Pulleyblank, W.R., The precedence-constrained asymmetric traveling salesman polytope (1995) Math.

This paper presents a mathematical model to design an enhanced ridesharing system with meet points and users’ preferable time windows. The introduction of meet points allows ridesharing operators to trade off the benefits of saving en-route delays and the cost of additional walking for some passengers to be collectively picked up or dropped off. This extension to the traditional door-to-door ridesharing problem brings more operation flexibility in urban areas (where potential requests may be densely distributed in neighborhood), and thus could achieve better system performance in terms of reducing the total travel time and increasing the served passengers. We design and implement a Tabu-based meta-heuristic algorithm to solve the proposed mixed integer linear program (MILP). To evaluate the validation and effectiveness of the proposed model and solution algorithm, several scenarios are designed and also resolved to optimality by CPLEX. Results demonstrate that (i) detailed route plan associated with passenger assignment to meet points can be obtained with en-route delay savings; (ii) as compared to CPLEX, the meta-heuristic algorithm bears the advantage of higher computation efficiency and produces good quality solutions with 8%~15% difference from the global optima; and (iii) introducing meet points to ridesharing system saves the total travel time by 2.7%-3.8% for small-scale ridesharing systems. More benefits are expected for ridesharing systems with large size of fleet. This study provides a new tool to efficiently operate the ridesharing system, particularly when the ride sharing vehicles are in short supply during peak hours. Traffic congestion mitigation will also be expected. © 2018 Li et al.

The column-generation subproblems are then variants of the shortest-path problem with resource constraints which can be solved well with dynamic-programming labeling algorithms. For vehicle-routing problems with a pickup-and-delivery structure, the strongest known dominance between two labels requires the delivery triangle inequality (DTI) for reduced costs to hold. When the direction of labeling is altered from forward labeling to backward labeling, the DTI requirement becomes the pickup triangle inequality (PTI). DTI and PTI cannot be guaranteed at the same time. The consequence seemed to be that bidirectional labeling, one of the most successful acceleration techniques developed over the last years, is not applicable with the strong dominance on both directions for problems with a pickup-and-delivery structure. In this paper, we show that bidirectional labeling with the strong dominance rules in forward as well as backward direction is possible by using different cost matrices in the two directions. We adopt the both-sided strong bidirectional labeling approach to integrate the standard robust and non-robust cuts. Moreover, a recent acceleration technique that dynamically adjusts the bidirectional half-way point is implemented. Full-fledged branch-cut-and-price algorithms are tested on the pickup-and-delivery problem with time windows (PDPTW). In particular, an in-depth analysis of different mono- and bidirectional labeling algorithms is presented. Overall, compared to the standard pure forward labeling-based algorithm, we obtain average reductions in computation time of more than 40 percent when solving PDPTW instances exactly. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Bidirectional labeling; Column generation; Pickup-and-delivery; Routing; Shortest-path problem with resource constraints","Costs; Dynamic programming; Flow measurement; Graph theory; Linear programming; Pickups; Tensors; Bidirectional labeling; Column generation; Pickup and delivery; Resource Constraint; Routing; Vehicle routing",,,,,"Baldacci, R., Bartolini, E., Mingozzi, A., An exact algorithm for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2011) Operations Research, 59 (2), pp. 414-426; Baldacci, R., Mingozzi, A., Roberti, R., New state-space relaxations for solving the traveling salesman problem with time windows (2012) INFORMS Journal on Computing, 24 (3), pp. 356-371; Battarra, M., Cordeau, J.-F., Iori, M., Pickup-and-delivery problems for goods transportation (2014) Vehicle routing, Chapter 6, pp. 161-191. , Toth P.

Several variants exist to accommodate for different problem types. In this paper, we discuss the fixed-destination, multi-depot travelling salesman problem, where several salesmen will start from different depots, and they are required to return to the depot they originated from. We propose a novel formulation for this problem using 2-index binary variables and node currents, and compare it to other 2-index formulations from the literature. This novel formulation requires less binary variables and continuous variables to formulate a problem, resulting in lower computation times. Using a large benchmark the effectiveness of the new formulation is demonstrated. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Fixed-destination problem; Integer programming; Node current; Travelling salesman","Bins; Integer programming; Optimization; Binary variables; Computation time; Continuous variables; Fixed-destination problem; Multi depots; Optimisation problems; Travelling salesman; Travelling salesman problem; Traveling salesman problem",,,,,"Applegate, D.L., Bixby, R.E., Chvatal, V., Cook, W.J., The traveling salesman problem – A computational study (2006), Princeton University Press; Ascheuer, N., Fischetti, M., Grötschel, M., Solving the asymmetric travelling salesman problem with time windows by branch-and-cut (2001) Mathematical Programming, 90 (3), pp. 475-506; Bektaş, T., The multiple traveling salesman problem: An overview of formulations and solution procedures (2006) Omega, 34 (3), pp. 209-219. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.omega.2004.10.004; Bektaş, T., Formulations and benders decomposition algorithms for multidepot salesmen problems with load balancing (2012) European Journal of Operational Research, 216 (1), pp. 83-93. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2011.07.020; Belenguer, J.-M., Benavent, E., Prins, C., Prodhon, C., Calvo, R.W., A branch-and-cut method for the capacitated location-routing problem (2011) Computers & Operations Research, 38 (6), pp. 931-941. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cor.2010.09.019; Benavent, E., Martínez, A., Multi-depot multiple TSP: A polyhedral study and computational results (2013) Annals of Operations Research, 207 (1), pp. 7-25; Benders, J.F., Partitioning procedures for solving mixed-variables programming problems (1962) Numerische Mathematik, 4 (1), pp. 238-252; Burger, M., Exact and compact formulation of the fixed-destination travelling salesman problem by cycle imposement through node currents (2014), pp. 83-88). , D.

This is a hard combinatorial optimization problem with the objective to find an optimal set of routes used by a fleet of vehicles to serve the demands a set of customers It is required that these vehicles return to the depot after serving customers' demand. The problem incorporates time windows, fleet and driver scheduling, pick-up and delivery in the planning horizon. The goal is to determine the scheduling of fleet and driver and routing policies of the vehicles. The objective is to minimize the overall costs of all routes over the planning horizon. We model the problem as a linear mixed integer program.

One of the issues discussed is about the transportation of ships carrying crude oil (tankers) which is distributed to many islands. The consideration is the cost of transportation which consists of travel costs and the cost of layover at the port. Crude oil to be distributed consists of several types. This paper develops routing and scheduling model taking into consideration some objective functions and constraints. The formulation of the mathematical model analyzed is to minimize costs based on the total distance visited by the tanker and minimize the cost of the ports. In order for the model of the problem to be more realistic and the cost calculated to be more appropriate then added a parameter that states the multiplier factor of cost increases as the charge of crude oil is filled. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Optimization;

This problem concerns determining a tour and its departure time at the depot that maximizes the collected profit minus the total travel cost (measured by total travel time). To deal with road congestion, travel times are considered to be time-dependent. We develop a tailored labeling algorithm to find the optimal tour. Furthermore, we introduce dominance criteria to discard unpromising labels. Our computational results demonstrate that the algorithm is capable of solving instances with up to 150 locations (75 pickup and delivery requests) to optimality. Additionally, we present a restricted dynamic programing heuristic to improve the computation time. This heuristic does not guarantee optimality, but is able to find the optimal solution for 32 instances out of the 34 instances. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Pickup and delivery problem; Profitable tour problem; Tailored labeling algorithm; Time-dependent travel times; Transportation","Motor transportation; Pickups; Profitability; Traffic congestion; Transportation; Travel time; Computational results; Dynamic programing; Labeling algorithms; Pickup and delivery; Pickup and delivery problems; Precedence constraints; Profitable tour problem; Time dependent; Optimization",,,,,"Balas, E., The prize-collecting traveling salesman problem (1989) Networks, 19 (6), pp. 621-636; Bisiani, R., Beam search (1987) Encyclopedia of artificial intelligence, pp. 56-58. , S.

Moreover, products are distributed to consumers from some of these retail stores based on product availability at inventory and by means of the same fleet of vehicles. This variant of the vehicle routing problem can be found in omni-channel retail distribution systems. Retail distribution systems are considered omni- or multi-channel systems when consumers can either place orders online or physically visit the stores to buy the products. In this problem, the decisions of assigning consumers to retail stores based on inventory availability are combined with finding the routes of vehicles. The new problem can be considered a generalization of both capacitated vehicle routing problem and the pickup and delivery problem. The paper presents a mathematical formulation to describe this problem and proposes two solution approaches (two-phase heuristic and multi-ant colony algorithm). We also generate new benchmark problem instances to evaluate the performance of the proposed solution approaches. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Heuristic; Logistics; Metaheuristic; Omni-channel routing; Routing","Ant colony optimization; Benchmarking; Costs; Fleet operations; Logistics; Online systems; Retail stores; Sales; Vehicles; Benchmark-problem instances; Capacitated vehicle routing problem; Channel routing; Heuristic; Mathematical formulation; Metaheuristic; Pickup and delivery problems; Routing; Vehicle routing",,,,,"Abdulkader, M.M.S., Gajpal, Y., ElMekkawy, T.Y., Hybridized ant colony algorithm for the multi compartment vehicle routing problem (2015) Appl.

Each customer has a demand, characterized by a weight, and pickups and deliveries are performed by a single ship of given weight capacity. The ship is able to visit a port only if the amount of cargo it carries is compatible with the draft limit of the port. We present an integer linear programming formulation and we show how classical valid inequalities from the literature can be adapted to the considered problem. We introduce heuristic procedures and a branch-and-cut exact algorithm. We examine, through extensive computational experiments, the impact of the various cuts and the performance of the proposed algorithms. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Branch-and-cut; Constructive heuristics; Draft limits; Maritime logistics; Routing; Traveling salesman","heuristics; system analysis; travel",,,,,"Augerat, P., Belenguer, J.M., Benavent, E., Corberán, A., Naddef, D., Separating capacity constraints in the CVRP using tabu search (1998) European Journal of Operational Research, 106 (2-3), pp. 546-557; Balas, E., Fischetti, M., Pulleyblank, W.R., The precedence-constrained asymmetric traveling salesman polytope (1995) Mathematical Programming, 68 (1-3), pp. 241-265; Battarra, M., Pessoa, A.A., Subramanian, A., Uchoa, E., Exact algorithms for the traveling salesman problem with draft limits (2014) European Journal of Operational Research, 235 (1), pp. 115-128; Cordeau, J.-F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54 (3), pp. 573-586; Cordeau, M., Nossack, J., Pesch, E., Mathematical formulations for a 1-full-truckload pickup-and-delivery problem (2015) European Journal of Operational Research, 242, pp. 1008-1016; Dumitrescu, I., Ropke, S., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The traveling salesman problem with pickup and delivery: polyhedral results and a branch-and-cut algorithm (2010) Mathematical Programming, 121 (2), pp. 269-305; Glomvik Rakke, J., Christiansen, M., Fagerholt, K., Laporte, G., The traveling salesman problem with draft limits (2012) Computers & Operations Research, 39 (9), pp. 2161-2167; Grötschel, M., Padberg, M.W., Lineare charakterisierungen von travelling salesman problemen (1977) Zeitschrift für Operations Research, 21 (1), pp. 33-64; Lin, S., Computer solutions of the traveling salesman problem (1965) Bell System Technical Journal, 44 (10), pp. 2245-2269; Ma, H., Cheang, B., Lim, A., Zhang, L., Zhu, Y., An investigation into the vehicle routing problem with time windows and link capacity constraints (2012) Omega, 40 (3), pp. 336-347; Notteboom, T.E., Vernimmen, B., The effect of high fuel costs on liner service configuration in container shipping (2009) Journal of Transport Geography, 17 (5), pp. 325-337; Padberg, M., Hong, S., On the symmetric travelling salesman problem: a computational study (1980) Mathematical Programming Study, 12, pp. 78-107; Reinelt, G., Tsplib–a traveling salesman problem library (1991) ORSA Journal on Computing, 3 (4), pp. 376-384; Ropke, S., Cordeau, J.-F., Branch and cut and price for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2009) Transportation Science, 43 (3), pp. 267-286; Ropke, S., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Models and branch-and-cut algorithms for pickup and delivery problems with time windows (2007) Networks, 49 (4), pp. 258-272; Ruland, K.S., Rodin, E.Y., The pickup and delivery problem: faces and branch-and-cut algorithm (1997) Computers & Mathematics with Applications, 33 (12), pp. 1-13; Tirschwell, P., (2014), pp. 1-24. , Berth productivity: the trends, outlook and market forces impacting ship turnaround times.

When the items to be transported are people, it is necessary to simultaneously consider a minimization of operating costs (perspective of transportation systems managers) and a reduction of the inconveniences for the user. An unexpected failure of planned scheduling in the transport system (e.g. a failure in the engine of a train) may cause a service disruption to a large number of passengers who would remain isolated at origin stations. The result of that situation would be a scattered distributed population in points, with a heterogeneous demand in terms of destinations and specific requirements of service. In this paper, a model of transportation on-demand is formulated to address an incidence which happens in a transit line (metro, trains), forcing to reschedule the service in such transit lines. The goal is to minimize the total cost associated to the delay experienced by users who have to be served by an auxiliary fleet to attend this incidence. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Disruptions; Railways; Rescheduling","Information systems; Operating costs; Railroads; Supply chains; Disruptions; Heterogeneous demand; Pickup and delivery; Railways; Rescheduling; Service disruptions; Transportation system; Unexpected Failures; Transportation",,,,,"Arriola, R., Ortega, F.A., Pozo, M.A., Aplicación de los Problemas Pickup and Delivery en la Gestión de Emergencias de un Sistema de Ferrocarril (2009) Actas De Las II Jornadas Sobre Modelos De Optimización Aplicados a La Planificación Robusta Y La Gestión De Los Servicios De Transporte En Caso De Emergencia (MORE 2009), pp. 55-64. , Sevilla, España, ISBN-13:978-84-692-6689-2; Baldacci, R., Bartolini, E., Mingozzi, A., An exact algorithm for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2011) Oper.

In the standard problem, operational costs are minimized, subject to full demand satisfaction and service level requirements. However, to enhance the practical applicability of solution methods, authors increasingly focus on problem variants that adopt additional real-life characteristics. First, this work introduces an up-to-date classification that distinguishes multiple categories of real-life characteristics. Second, the wide range of solution methods proposed in the literature is reviewed in a structured manner. Although the existing literature is reviewed exhaustively, specific attention is devoted to recent developments. Third, an extensive overview table provides full details on all problem characteristics and solution methods applied in each paper discussed. Fourth, lacunae in research conducted to date and opportunities for future work are identified. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Demand-responsive transportation; Dial-a-ride; Literature review;

In this paper, we investigate a new vehicle sharing system using AVs, referred to as autonomous vehicle sharing and reservation (AVSR). In such a system, travelers can request AV trips ahead of time and the AVSR system operator will optimally arrange AV pickup and delivery schedules and AV trip chains based on these requests. A linear programming model is proposed to efficiently solve for optimal solutions for AV trip chains and required fleet size through constructed AVSR networks. Case studies show that AVSR can significantly increase vehicle use rate (VUR) and consequentially reduce vehicle ownership significantly. In the meantime, it is found that the actual vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in AVSR systems is not significantly more than that of conventional taxis, despite inevitable empty hauls for vehicle relocation in AVSR systems. The results imply huge potential benefits from AVSR systems on improving mobility and sustainability of our current transportation systems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Autonomous vehicle (AV); Linear programming; Mobility and sustainability; Pickup and delivery; Vehicle miles traveled (VMT); Vehicle sharing and reservation (AVSR); Vehicle use rate (VUR)","Chains; Linear programming; Motor transportation; Pickups; Reservation systems; Sustainable development; Autonomous Vehicles; Linear programming models; Optimal solutions; Pickup and delivery; Potential benefits; Transportation system; Vehicle use; Vehicle-miles traveled; Vehicles; linear programing; mobility; ownership; sustainability; transportation planning; transportation technology; travel behavior; travel time",,,,,"Bansal, P., Kockelman, K.M., Singh, A., Assessing public opinions of and interest in new vehicle technologies: an Austin perspective (2016) Transp.

The problem is equivalently transformed into a variant of the asymmetric vehicle routing problem with time windows (a-VRPTW) based on a determined-activities-on-vertex (DAOV) graph. We present an arc-flow formulation and propose a branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm to exactly solve it. Computational results on a set of randomly generated instances show that the proposed algorithm outperforms CPLEX in terms of efficiency and effectiveness and the separation mode is advantageous over the stay-with mode. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","A-VRPTW; Branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm; Container drayage; Separation mode","algorithm; containerization; efficiency measurement; freight transport; performance assessment; routing; trucking",,,,,"Bettinelli, A., Ceselli, A., Righini, G., A branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm for the multi-depot heterogeneous vehicle routing problem with time windows (2011) Transp.

Consequently, our primary objective is to explore solutions for real-world VRPs with a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles, multi-depot subcontractors (drivers), and pickup/delivery time window and location constraints. We use a nested bi-criteria genetic algorithm (GA) to minimize the total time to complete all jobs with the fewest number of route drivers. Our model will explore the issue of weighting the objectives (total time vs. number of drivers) and provide Pareto front solutions that can be used to make decisions on a case-by-case basis. Three different real-world data sets were used to compare the results of our GA vs. transportation field experts’ job assignments. For the three data sets, all 21 Pareto efficient solutions yielded improved overall job completion times. In 57 % (12/21) of the cases, the Pareto efficient solutions also utilized fewer drivers than the field experts’ job allocation strategies. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Bi-criteria genetic algorithm; Hard and soft time windows; Multi-depot transportation problem; Pareto front; Vehicle routing problem","Algorithms; Fleet operations; Network routing; Pareto principle; Routing algorithms; Transportation routes; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Virtual reality; Bi-criteria; Pareto front; Soft time windows; Transportation problem; Vehicle Routing Problems; Genetic algorithms",,,,,"Abounacer, R., Rekik, M., Renaud, J., An exact solution approach for multi-objective location transportation problem for disaster response (2012) CIRRELT, 26, pp. 1-32; Aneja, Y.P., Nair, P.K., (1979) Bicriteria transportation problem.

SAVs essentially provide a dial-a-ride service to travelers, but the large number of vehicles involved (tens of thousands of SAVs to replace personal vehicles) results in SAV routing causing significant congestion. We combine the dial-a-ride service constraints with the linear program for system optimal dynamic traffic assignment, resulting in a congestion-aware formulation of the SAV routing problem. Traffic flow is modeled through the link transmission model, an approximate solution to the kinematic wave theory of traffic flow. SAVs interact with travelers at origins and destinations. Due to the large number of vehicles involved, we use a continuous approximation of flow to formulate a linear program. Optimal solutions demonstrate that peak hour demand is likely to have greater waiting and in-vehicle travel times than off-peak demand due to congestion. SAV travel times were only slightly greater than system optimal personal vehicle route choice. In addition, solutions can determine the optimal fleet size to minimize congestion or maximize service. © 2017","Dynamic traffic assignment; Shared autonomous vehicles; System optimal; Traffic flow","Linear programming; Traffic control; Transportation routes; Travel time; Vehicles; Approximate solution; Autonomous Vehicles; Continuous approximations; Dynamic traffic assignments; Kinematic-wave theory; Service constraints; System-optimal; Traffic flow; Traffic congestion; routing; traffic congestion; traffic management; transport vehicle; travel time",,,,,"Agatz, N., Erera, A., Savelsbergh, M., Wang, X., Optimization for dynamic ride-sharing: a review (2012) Eur.

The demand-adaptive service connects passengers from their origin/destination to the fixed-route service in order to improve accessability. The proposed hybrid design is unique in that it operates the demand-adaptive service with a stable headway to cover all stops along a paired fixed-route line. Pairing demand-adaptive vehicles with a fixed-route line simplifies the complexity of on-demand routing, because the vehicles can follow a more predictable path and can be dispatched on intervals coordinated with the fixed-route line. The design of the two services are closely coupled to minimize the total system cost, which incudes both the transit agency's operating cost and the user cost. The optimal design model is formulated as a mixed integer program and solved using a commercially available metaheuristic. Numerical experiments are conducted to compare the demand adaptive paired-line hybrid transit (DAPL-HT) system with two related transit systems that may be considered its special cases: a fixed-route system and a flexible-route system. We show that the DAPL-HT system outperforms the other two systems under a wide range of demand levels and in various scenarios of input parameters. A discrete-event simulation model is also developed and applied to confirm the correctness of the analytical results. © 2017","Demand adaptive service; Discrete-event simulation; Fixed-route service; Hybrid transit system","Costs; Integer programming; Mass transportation; Adaptive services; Analytical results; Discrete-event simulation model; Fixed-route service; Mixed-integer programs; Numerical experiments; Optimal design model; Transit systems; Discrete event simulation; analytical method; cost analysis; demand analysis; service quality; simulation; transportation system",,,,,"Aldaihani, M.M., Quadrifoglio, L., Dessouky, M.M., Hall, R., Network design for a grid hybrid transit service (2004) Transp.

This paper presents the first metaheuristic method to solve a new variant of the PDP which we called SPDPTWPD (Selective PDP with Time Windows and Paired Demands). In this variant, the precedence constraints (paired demands) and the choice of sites to be served (selective aspect) must be considered.

Box 124 Blindern, Oslo, Norway","This paper studies the effect on carbon emissions of consolidation of shipments on trucks. New positioning and communication technologies, as well as decision support systems for vehicle routing, enable better utilization of vehicle capacity, reduced travel distance, and thereby carbon emission reductions. We present a novel carbon emission analysis method that determines the emission savings obtained by an individual transport provider, who receives customer orders for outbound deliveries as well as pickup orders from supply locations. The transport provider can improve vehicle utilization by performing pickups and deliveries jointly instead of using separate trucks. In our model we assume that the transport provider minimizes costs by use of a tool that calculates detailed vehicle routing plans, i.e., an assignment of each transport order to a specific vehicle in the fleet, and the sequence of customer visit for each vehicle. We compare a basic set-up, in which pickups and deliveries are segregated and performed with separate vehicles, with two consolidation set-ups where pickups and deliveries may be mixed more or less freely on a single vehicle. By allowing mixing, the average vehicle load will increase and the total driven distance will decrease. To compare carbon emissions for the three set-ups, we use a carbon assessment method that uses the distance driven and the average load factor. An increase in the load factor can reduce part of the emission savings from consolidation. We find that emission savings are relatively large in case of small vehicles and for delivery and pickup locations that are relatively far from the depot. However, if a truck visits many demand and supply locations before returning to the depot, we observe negligible carbon emission decreases or even emission increases for consolidation set-ups, meaning that in such cases investing in consolidation through joint pickups and deliveries may not be effective. The results of our study will be useful for transport users and providers, policymakers, as well as vehicle routing technology vendors. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Consolidation; Pickup and delivery","Artificial intelligence; Automobiles; Consolidation; Decision support systems; Emission control; Fleet operations; Location; Pickups; Trucks; Vehicle routing; Carbon emission reductions; Carbon emissions; Communication technologies; Demand and supply; Pickup and delivery; Routing technologies; Specific vehicles; Vehicle utilization; Vehicles; carbon emission; decision support system; policy making; routing; transport vehicle; transportation technology; trucking",,,,,"Anily, S., Federgruen, A., One warehouse multiple retailer systems with vehicle routing costs (1990) Manage.

In this problem the vehicle fleet consists of trucks and trailers which may be decoupled. A set of customers has to be served and some of the customers can only be accessed by the truck without the trailer. This gives rise to the planning of truck-and-trailer routes containing truck-only subroutes, in addition to truck-only routes and truck-and-trailer routes without subroutes. We propose a branch-and-price algorithm for the TTRPTW, using problem specific enhancements in the pricing scheme and alternative lower bound computations. We also tailor an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm to the TTRPTW in order to obtain good initial columns. When compared to existing metaheuristic algorithms we obtain highly competitive results. Some instances with up to 100 customers are solved to optimality with the proposed branch-and-price algorithm. © 2017 The Authors","Branch-and-price; Column generation; Large neighborhood search; Truck and trailer; Vehicle routing","Costs; Fleet operations; Integer programming; Linear programming; Optimization; Sales; Truck transportation; Trucks; Urban planning; Vehicle routing; Adaptive large neighborhood searches; Branch and price; Branch-and-price algorithms; Column generation; Infrastructure services; Large neighborhood search; Meta heuristic algorithm; Truck and trailer routing problems; Truck trailers",,,,,"Baldacci, R., Mingozzi, A., Roberti, R., New route relaxation and pricing strategies for the vehicle routing problem (2011) Oper.

This problem is motivated by a case study carried out in an oil company that operates in Brazil. Based on this study, we propose a mixed integer programming model that extends the classical pickup and delivery problem with time windows. This problem belongs to the NP-hard class and its solution is very challenging in practice. To model specific features of the addressed case, we include new constraints in the classical formulation, which makes it even more challenging for general purpose optimization solvers. To overcome this, we propose two branch-and-cut methods that use valid inequalities especially developed for the oil company case. Computational results performed with a real data set provided by the company show that the proposed branch-and-cut methods are effective and able to solve more instances than a state of the art general purpose optimization solver.","Branch-and-cut method; Oil industry; Pickup and delivery problem; Ship routing and scheduling",,,,,,"Andersson, H., Hoff, A., Christiansen, M., Hasle, G., Løkketangen, A., Industrial aspects and literature survey: Combined inventory management and routing (2010) Computers & Operations Research, 37 (9), pp. 1515-1536. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cor.2009.11.009; Balas, E., Fischetti, M., Pulleyblank, W.R., The precedence-constrained asymmetric travelling salesman polytope (1995) Mathematical Programming, 68 (1-3), pp. 214-265. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01585767; Baldacci, R., Bartolini, E., Mingozzi, A., An exact algorithm for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2011) Operations Research, 59 (2), pp. 414-426. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/opre.1100.0881; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.F., Gribkovskaia, I., Laporte, G., Static pickup and delivery problems: A classification scheme and survey (2007) Top, 15 (1), pp. 1-31. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11750-007-0009-0; (2011) Recuperado em 30 de Abril de 2012, , http://www.mdic.gov.br/sitio/, de; Brønmo, G., Nygreen, B., Lysgaard, J., Column generation approaches to ship scheduling with flexible cargo sizes (2010) European Journal of Operational Research, 200 (1), pp. 139-150. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2008.12.028; Christiansen, M., Decomposition of a combined inventory and time constrained ship routing problem (1999) Transportation Science, 33 (1), pp. 1-14. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/trsc.33.1.3; Christiansen, M., Fagerholt, K., Ronen, D., Ship routing and scheduling: Status and perspectives (2004) Transportation Science, 38 (1), pp. 1-18. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/trsc.1030.0036; Christiansen, M., Fagerholt, K., Ronen, D., Nygreen, B., Maritime transportation (2007) Handbook in Operations Research and Management Science, pp. 189-284. , C.

Despite the increasing competition, over 20% of all vehicles run empty on European roads. As a remedy, freight exchanges have been established to bridge such supply-demand imbalances, with the largest markets trading over 200,000 daily offers. Carriers searching for profit-maximizing freights on such markets face a Profit-Maximizing Pickup and Delivery Selection Problem (PPDSP) that has not yet been addressed in previous research. In this paper, we develop a novel graph search that branches on feasible routes for an exact solution and, based on this, we develop a randomized search heuristic for the single vehicle case, a greedy heuristic for the multi-vehicle case, and a Maximum Set Packing formulation for the case of homogeneous and heterogeneous fleets. Computational experiments show that most instances of the various setups can be solved optimally and much faster than the solution offered by the Gurobi optimizer. Both heuristics are highly efficient and the problem of fleets can be solved almost as quickly as the single vehicle case. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Branch and bound; Decision support systems; Heuristics; Logistics; Transportation","Artificial intelligence; Branch and bound method; Commerce; Decision support systems; Heuristic algorithms; Logistics; Optimization; Pickups; Profitability; Transportation; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Computational experiment; Heterogeneous fleet; Heuristics; Pickup and delivery; Randomized search; Road freight transportations; Selection problems; Supply demand imbalance; Freight transportation",,,,,"Arda, Y., Crama, Y., Pironet, T., A profitable pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2008) Proceedings of the 22nd annual conference of the Belgian operations research society (ORBEL 22); Baldacci, R., Bartolini, E., Mingozzi, A., An exact algorithm for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2011) Operations Research, 59 (2), pp. 414-426; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Gribkovskaia, I., Laporte, G., Static pickup and delivery problems: a classification scheme and survey (2007) TOP, 15 (1), pp. 1-31; Caplice, C., Sheffi, Y., Combinatorial auctions for truckload transportation (2006) Combinatorial auctions, pp. 539-572. , P.

To conduct a meaningful comparison, the optimal design problems for both systems are formulated using a same analytical framework based on the continuous approximation approach. A comprehensive numerical experiment is performed to compare various cost components corresponding to the optimal designs, and a discrete-event simulation model is developed to validate the analysis. The analytical and simulation results agree with each other well, with a discrepancy in the total system cost less than 5% in most test scenarios. These results also suggest that the line-based system consistently outperforms the zone-based system in terms of both agency and user costs, for all scenarios tested. Compared to the zone-based design, the line-based design features a sparser fixed-route network (resulting in larger stop spacing) but a higher dispatching frequency. It is concluded that the higher efficiency of the line-based design is likely derived from the strategy of operating e-hailing vehicles with a more regular route/headway structure and allowing ride-sharing. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Continuous approximation; Discrete-event simulation; E-hailing service; Fixed-route service; Relative spatial position","Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Light rail transit; Mass transportation; Optimal systems; Vehicles; Continuous approximations; Design features; Discrete-event simulation model; Fixed-route service; Higher efficiency; Numerical experiments; Spatial positions; Transit systems; Discrete event simulation; computer simulation; spatial analysis; transportation system",,,,,"Aldaihani, M.M., Quadrifoglio, L., Dessouky, M.M., Hall, R., Network design for a grid hybrid transit service (2004) Transp.

The aim is to incorporate carbon emissions into production inventory and routing decisions. The model is characterized by an additional flow-related cost structure, which generalizes models for pollution-routing problems and production inventory and routing problems. Correspondingly, we develop a branch-and-price heuristic by incorporating a column-generation formulation based on the Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition. In addition, we design an ad hoc label-setting algorithm to deal with time-slice networks in pricing subproblems. Computational results allow us to provide managerial insights concerning reduction of carbon emissions in supply chains. We prove that the model has the potential to reduce emission levels of carbon dioxide and operational costs. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Branch and bound; Dynamic programming; Environmental studies; Production planning; Routing",,,,,,"Absi, N., Archetti, C., Dauzere-Peres, S., Feillet, D., A two-phase iterative heuristic approach for the production routing problem (2015) Transportation Science, pp. 784-795; Achterberg, T., SCIP: solving constraint integer programs (2009) Mathematical Programming Computation, 1 (1), pp. 1-41; Adulyasak, Y., Cordeau, J.-F., Jans, R., Benders decomposition for production routing under demand uncertainty (2015) Operations Research, 63 (4), pp. 851-867; Adulyasak, Y., Cordeau, J.-F., Jans, R., Optimization-based adaptive large neighborhood search for the production routing problem (2014) Transportation Science, 48 (1), pp. 20-45; Adulyasak, Y., Cordeau, J.-F., Jans, R., Formulations and branch-and-cut algorithms for multivehicle production and inventory routing problems (2014) INFORMS Journal on Computing, 26 (1), pp. 103-120; Pollution-inventory routing problem with perishable goods (2014) Logistics Operations, Supply Chain Management and Sustainability, pp. 585-96. , Al Shamsi A, Al Raisi A, Aftab M; Alkawaleet, N., Hsieh, Y.-F., Wang, Y., Inventory routing problem with CO2 emissions consideration (2014) Logistics Operations, Supply Chain Management and Sustainability, pp. 611-9; Archetti, C., Bertazzi, L., Paletta, G., Speranza, M.G., Analysis of the maximum level policy in a production-distribution system (2011) Computers & Operations Research, 38 (12), pp. 1731-1746; Armentano, V., Shiguemoto, A., Lokketangen, A., Tabu search with path relinking for an integrated production-distribution problem (2011) Computers & Operations Research, 38 (8), pp. 1199-1209; Bard, J.F., Nananukul, N., Heuristics for a multiperiod inventory routing problem with production decisions (2009) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 57 (3), pp. 713-723; Bard, J.F., Nananukul, N., The integrated production-inventory-distribution-routing problem (2009) Journal of Scheduling, 12 (3), pp. 257-280; Bard, J.F., Nananukul, N., A branch-and-price algorithm for an integrated production and inventory routing problem (2010) Computers & Operations Research, 37 (12), pp. 2202-2217; Bektas, T., Laporte, G., The pollution-routing problem (2011) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 45 (8), pp. 1232-1250; Bjørndal, E., Bjørndal, M., Pardalos, P., Rönnqvist, M., Energy, natural resources and environmental economics (2010) Springer Science & Business Media; Boudia, M., Louly, M., Prins, C., A reactive grasp and path relinking for a combined production-distribution problem (2007) Computers & Operations Research, 34 (11), pp. 3402-3419; Boudia, M., Prins, C., A memetic algorithm with dynamic population management for an integrated production-distribution problem (2009) European Journal of Operational Research, 195 (3), pp. 703-715; Chandra, P., A dynamic distribution model with warehouse and customer replenishment requirements (1993) Journal of the Operational Research Society, pp. 681-92; Chandra, P., Fisher, M.L., Coordination of production and distribution planning (1994) European Journal of Operational Research, 72 (3), pp. 503-517; Cinar, D., Gakis, K., Pardalos, P.M., Reduction of CO2 emissions in cumulative multi-trip vehicle routing problems with limited duration (2015) Environmental Modeling & Assessment, 20 (4), pp. 273-284; Desaulniers, G., Branch-and-price-and-cut for the split-delivery vehicle routing problem with time windows (2010) Operations Research, 58 (1), pp. 179-192; Engineer, F.G., Furman, K.C., Nemhauser, G.L., Savelsbergh, M.W., Song, J.-H., A branch-price-and-cut algorithm for single-product maritime inventory routing (2012) Operations Research, 60 (1), pp. 106-122; Engineer, F.G., Nemhauser, G.L., Savelsbergh, M.W., Song, J.-H., The fixed-charge shortest-path problem (2012) INFORMS Journal on Computing, 24 (4), pp. 578-596; Franceschetti, A., Honhon, D., Van Woensel, T., Bektaş, T., Laporte, G., The time-dependent pollution-routing problem (2013) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 56, pp. 265-293; Fumero, F., Vercellis, C., Synchronized development of production, inventory, and distribution schedules (1999) Transportation Science, 33 (3), pp. 330-340; Hammami, R., Nouira, I., Frein, Y., Carbon emissions in a multi-echelon production-inventory model with lead time constraints (2015) International Journal of Production Economics, 164 (6), pp. 292-307; Irnich, S., Desaulniers, G., Shortest path problems with resource constraints (2005) Column generation, pp. 33-65. , G.

The main contribution of this paper is a specific categorization of problems that have temporal and ordering constraints. We propose a novel taxonomy that emphasizes the differences between temporal and ordering constraints, and organizes the current literature according to the nature of those constraints. We summarize widely used models and methods from the task allocation literature and related areas, such as vehicle routing and scheduling problems, showing similarities and differences. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Multi-robot coordination; Task allocation; Taxonomy; Temporal constraints; Time-extended assignments","Vehicle routing; Multi-robot coordination; Ordering constraints; Task allocation; Temporal constraints; Time-extended assignments; Vehicle routing and scheduling; Taxonomies",,,,,"Gerkey, B.P., Matarić, M.J., A formal analysis and taxonomy of task allocation in multi-robot systems (2004) Int.

In this work we present the best strategies to solve this challenging problem. It is important to note that although the solvers in the last decade have evolved enormously, for this particular application we cannot get solutions with satisfactory quality in reasonable computational time with only the initial proposed model in Rocha et al. (Comput Chem Eng 33(12):2123–2133, 2013). To efficiently solve this problem we propose a novel decomposition algorithm and reformulations based on a cascading knapsack structure that turn out to be applicable in a wide range of problems. We show that the novel decomposition algorithm is the most appropriate method to solve the petroleum supply planning problem if we consider more than two tankers to offload each platform. In the case of one or two tankers to offload each platform, the hull relaxation formulation based on the cascading knapsack structure introduced after an inventory reformulation at platforms is the best option if one is to solve this problem. For the real application, these solution alternatives allow us to implement a general algorithm that automatically switches to the best solution option depending on the structure of the problem. This model is being tested at PETROBRAS and is proving an effective tool to help integrate its petroleum supply chain as well as to do what-if analysis to look for alternative solutions never before thought of. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Decomposition algorithm; Disjunctive programming; Mixed integer programming; Petroleum supply planning; Reformulations","Integer programming; Petroleum refining; Supply chains; Decomposition algorithm; Disjunctive programming; Mixed integer programming; Petroleum supply; Reformulations; Problem solving",,,,,"Balas, E., Disjunctive programming: properties of the convex hull of feasible points (1998) Discrete Appl Math, 89 (1-3), pp. 3-44; Balas, E., Jeroslow, R., Canonical cuts on the unit hypercube (1972) SIAM J Appl Math, 23 (1), pp. 61-69; Balas, E., Ceria, S., Cornuéjols, G., Mixed 0–1 programming by lift-and-project in a branch-and-cut framework (1996) Manag Sci, 42 (9), pp. 1229-1246; Barnhart, C., Johnson, E.L., Nemhauser, G.L., Savelsbergh, M.W.P., Vance, P.H., Branch-and-price: column generation for solving huge integer programs (1996) Oper Res, 46, pp. 316-329; Brown, G.G., Graves, G.W., Ronen, D., Scheduling ocean transportation of crude oil (1987) Manag Sci, 33, pp. 335-346; Charnes, A., Cooper, W.W., Mellon, B., Blending aviation gasolines (1952) Econometrica, 135 (22), pp. 135-159; Chu, Y., Xia, Q., Generating benders cuts for a general class of integer programming problems.

When global capacity is not sufficient, the choice of locations to be served is an additional problem (selective variant). This paper presents an exact algorithm which solves the Selective PDPTW, where precedence constraints must be considered (paired demands). The objective is to minimize the total transportation cost or to maximize the profit. We tested our proposed algorithm on benchmark instances from the literature and on our instances. The computational results obtained show the efficiency of our approach. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Benchmarking; Cybernetics; Location; Computational results; Exact algorithms; Global capacity; Pickup and delivery; Pickup and delivery problems with time windows; Precedence constraints; Time constraints; Transportation cost; Pickups",,,,,"Desrosiers, J., Dumas, Y., Solomon, M.M., Soumis, F., Time constrained routing and scheduling (1995) Handbooks in Operations Research and Management Science, 8, pp. 35-139; Christofides, N., The vehicle routing problem (1976) Revue Française D'automatique, D'informatique et de Recherche Operationnelle.

All requests consist of a one- to-one pickup and delivery with time windows. Moreover, as the clients are seniors, a maximum ride time is enforced to minimize user discomfort and inconvenience. The problem is similar to the classical dial-a-ride Problem (DARP) or the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (PDPTW). However, due to the limited resources, not all requests can be met within the time horizon and, therefore, the problem is to select a subset of requests such that the total weight of all served requests is maximized. Additionally, all drivers op-erate on a volunteer basis, thus aspects such as multi-depots, heterogeneous vehicles, and time windows on vehicles also need to be considered. This document formally defines the STP and presents related work and a mixed integer programming formulation for the STP. © Copyright 2017, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

In this problem, the loading compartment of a vehicle is modeled as a linear LIFO stack. When an item is picked up, it is positioned on top of the stack. When it is on top of the stack, it can be delivered without additional handling. Otherwise, items on top must be unloaded before the delivery and reloaded afterwards, which requires time. We define two rehandling policies. For both policies, rehandling is only allowed at delivery locations and there is no specific reloading order for the rehandled items. Under the first policy, only compulsory rehandling is allowed. Under the second policy, in addition to compulsory rehandling, preventive rehandling is allowed. For each policy, we propose a branch-price-and-cut algorithm with an ad hoc dominance criterion for the labeling algorithm used to generate routes.

Specifically, the method features a master problem that ignores combinatorial constraints, and a feasibility subproblem that uses propagation to check the feasibility of these constraints and performs conflict analysis to derive nogood cuts. The BCE method also leverages conflict-based branching rules and strengthens cuts in a post-processing step. Experimental results on the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows show that BCE is a potential alternative to branch-and-cut. In particular, BCE dominates branch-and-cut, both in proving optimality and in finding high-quality solutions quickly. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,"Computer programming; Constraint theory; Integer programming; Branch and cut; Branching rules; Conflict analysis; High-quality solutions; Master problems; Post processing; Separation algorithms; Vehicle routing problem with time windows; Vehicle routing",,,,,"Achterberg, T., Conflict analysis in mixed integer programming (2007) Discrete Optim, 4 (1), pp. 4-20; Achterberg, T., Koch, T., Martin, A., Branching rules revisited (2005) Oper.

While a growing body of research acknowledges the importance of the partner selection and cost allocation process, no extensive study has been performed on the numerical relationship between specific company traits, applied allocation mechanisms and collaborative performance. This paper investigates the impact of coalition characteristics on attainable collaborative savings and cost allocation values in a joint route planning context. Results indicate that collaborative order sharing provides significant operational benefits and can be based on intuitively appealing cost allocation techniques, which may reduce alliance complexity and enforce the strength of mutual partner relationships.","Cost allocation; Horizontal carrier collaboration; Joint route planning; Partner selection","Costs; Failure analysis; Allocation mechanism; Carrier collaboration; Collaborative performance; Cost allocation; Operational benefits; Partner selection; Route planning; Strategic partnership; Cost accounting",,,,,"Bailey, E., Unnikrishnan, A., Lin, D.Y., Models for minimizing backhaul costs through freight collaboration (2011) Transportation Research Record, 2224 (1), pp. 51-60; Brouthers, K., Brouthers, L., Wilkinson, T., Strategic alliances: Choose your partners (1995) Long Range Planning, 28 (3), pp. 18-25; Cruijssen, F., Bräysy, O., Dullaert, W., Fleuren, H., Salomon, M., Joint route planning under varying market conditions (2007) International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, 37 (4), pp. 287-304; Cruijssen, F., Cools, M., Dullaert, W., Horizontal cooperation in logistics: Opportunities and impediments (2007) Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 43 (2), pp. 129-142; Cruijssen, F., Dullaert, W., Fleuren, H., Horizontal cooperation in transport and logistics: A literature review (2007) Transportation Journal, 46 (3), pp. 22-39; Cruijssen, F., Salomon, M., Empirical study: Order sharing between transportation companies may result in cost reductions between 5 to 15 percent (2004) CentER Discussion Paper, , https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=607062, Accessed 5 April 2017.

Box 4761 Sluppen, Trondheim, Norway","An optimisation model and a solution method for maintenance routing and scheduling at offshore wind farms are proposed. The model finds the optimal schedule for maintaining the turbines and the optimal routes for the crew transfer vessels to service the turbines along with the number of technicians required for each vessel. The model takes into account multiple vessels, multiple periods (days), multiple Operation & Maintenance (O&M) bases, and multiple wind farms. We develop an algorithm based on the Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition method, where a mixed integer linear program is solved for each subset of turbines to generate all feasible routes and maintenance schedules for the vessels for each period. The routes have to consider several constraints such as weather conditions, the availability of vessels, and the number of technicians available at the O&M base. An integer linear program model is then proposed to find the optimal route configuration along with the maintenance schedules that minimise maintenance costs, including travel, technician and penalty costs. The computational experiments show that the proposed optimisation model and solution method find optimal solutions to the problem in reasonable computing times. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Maintenance scheduling; Offshore wind farm; Routing problem","Electric utilities; Integer programming; Maintenance; Optimization; Scheduling; Service vessels; Turbines; Wind power; Computational experiment; Decomposition methods; Integer linear programs; Maintenance routing; Maintenance schedules; Maintenance scheduling; Mixed integer linear program; Routing problems; Offshore wind farms",,,,,"Baldacci, R., Bartolini, E., Mingozzi, A., An exact algorithm for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2011) Operations Research, 59, pp. 414-426; Barnhart, C., Johnson, E.L., Nemhauser, G.L., Savelsbergh, M.V.P., Vance, P.H., Column generation for solving huge integer programs (1998) Operations Research, 46 (3), pp. 316-329; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Gribkovskaia, I., Laporte, G., Static pickup and delivery problems: A classification scheme and survey (2007) TOP, 15, pp. 1-31; Besnard, F., Patriksson, M., Strőmberg, A., Wojciechowski, A., Bertling, L., An optimization framework for opportunistic maintenance of offshore wind power system (2009) Proceedings of IEEE Bucharest powertech conference, Bucharest, Romania; Besnard, F., Patriksson, M., Strőmberg, A., Wojciechowski, A., Bertling, L., A stochastic model for opportunistic service maintenance planning of offshore wind farms (2011) Proceedings of the IEEE powertech conference, Trondheim, Norway; Bjelić, N., Vidović, M., Popović, D., Variable neighborhood search algorithm for heterogeneous traveling repairmen problem with time windows (2013) Expert Systems with Applications, 40, pp. 5997-6006; Bock, S., Solving the traveling repairman problem on a line with general processing times and deadlines (2015) European Journal of Operational Research, 244, pp. 690-703; Brønmo, G., Nygreen, B., Lysgaard, J., Column generation approaches to ship routing and scheduling with flexible cargo sizes (2010) European Journal of Operational Research, 200, pp. 139-150; Byon, E., Pérez, E., Ding, Y., Ntaimo, L., Simulation of wind farm operations and maintenance using discrete event system specification (2011) Simulation, 87, pp. 1093-1117; Camci, F., The travelling maintainer problem: Integration of condition-based maintenance with the travelling salesman problem (2014) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 65, pp. 1423-1436; Camci, F., Maintenance scheduling of geographically distributed assets with prognostics information (2015) European Journal of Operational Research, 245, pp. 506-516; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem: Models and algorithms (2007) Annals of Operations Research, 153, pp. 29-46; Dantzig, G.B., Wolfe, P., Decomposition principle for linear programs (1960) Operations Research, 8, pp. 101-111; Dumas, Y., Desrosiers, J., Soumis, F., The pickup and delivery problem with time windows (1991) European Journal of Operational Research, 54 (1), pp. 7-22; Dai, L., Stålhane, M., Utne, I.B., Routing and scheduling of maintenance fleet for offshore wind farms (2015) Wind Engineering, 39, pp. 15-30; Dewilde, T., Cattrysse, D., Coene, S., Spieksma, F.C.R., Vansteenwegen, P., Heuristics for the traveling repairman problem with profits (2013) Computers & Operations Research, 40, pp. 1700-1707; European Committee for Standardization (2010) Maintenance: Maintenance terminology.

Modeling the AV fleet management problem will bring about new classes of vehicle routing, scheduling, and fleet management problems; nevertheless, the existing literature related to vehicle routing, scheduling, and fleet management is a valuable foundation for future research on the AV fleet management problem. This paper classifies the broadly defined AV fleet management problem by using existing taxonomic categories in the literature; adds additional, or more nuanced, dimensions to existing taxonomic categories; and presents new taxonomic categories to classify specific AV fleet management problems. The broadly defined AV fleet management problem can be classified as a dynamic multivehicle pickup and delivery problem with explicit or implicit time window constraints. Existing studies that fit into this class of fleet management problems are reviewed. New taxonomy categories presented in this paper include fleet size elasticity, reservation structure, accept-reject decision maker, reservation time frame, ridesharing, vehicle repositioning, underlying network structure, and network congestion.

This problem is a generalization of the split delivery vehicle routing problem with time windows (SDVRPTW), which consists of determining a set of least-cost vehicle routes to serve all customers while respecting the restrictions of vehicle capacity and time windows. The travel cost per unit distance is a linear function of the vehicle weight and the customer demand can be fulfilled by multiple vehicles. To solve this problem, we propose an exact branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm, where the pricing subproblem is a variant of the resource-constrained elementary shortest path problem. We first prove that at least one optimal solution to the pricing subproblem is associated with an extreme delivery pattern, and then we design a tailored and novel label-setting algorithm to solve the pricing subproblem. Computational results show that our proposed algorithm can handle both the SDVRPTW and our new problem effectively. © 2016 INFORMS.","Branch and price and cut; Linear weight-related cost; Split delivery; Time windows; Vehicle routing","Costs; Graph theory; Integer programming; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Branch-and-price-and-cut; Computational results; Label-setting algorithm; Shortest path problem; Split delivery; Split delivery vehicle routing; Time windows; Vehicle Routing Problems; Problem solving",,,,,"Archetti, C., Bouchard, M., Desaulniers, G., Enhanced branch and price and cut for vehicle routing with split deliveries and time windows (2011) Transportation Sci, 45 (3), pp. 285-298; Azi, N., Gendreau, M., Potvin, J.-Y., An exact algorithm for a vehicle routing problem with time windows and multiple use of vehicles (2010) Eur.

The problem is modeled as a multitrip pickup and delivery problem with time windows and manpower planning (MTPDPTW-MP) that not only needs to design and schedule ambulance routes satisfying a series of constraints but also requires staff scheduling. Because of the strict limits on route duration, each ambulance traverses several routes per day, which, starting and terminating at the depot, complete a series of pickup and delivery operations to serve the clients. A feasible route demands a driver and several assistants to serve the clients and needs to satisfy some constraints, such as capacity, pickup before delivery, time windows, etc. The objective is hierarchical in that it primarily serves as many clients as possible, then minimizes the operational cost, and finally strikes a balance for the staff workload. Theoretically, MTPDPTW-MP, which is a combination of two well known NP-hard problems (i.e., the pickup and delivery problem with time windows and the staff scheduling problem), is difficult to solve. In this study, we propose an iterated local search metaheuristic that uses a variable neighborhood descent procedure in the local search phase.We use a modified regret insertion method to construct solutions; a heuristic backtracking algorithm is designed to schedule staff. To speed up the process,we adapt the segment-based evaluation for moves and reduce the neighborhoods explored based on the characteristics of the problem. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was tested in real-world instances. Results showed that it can serve more requests than the manually designed plans. In addition, the performance of the proposed algorithm was evaluated on a simplified problem: the multitrip vehicle routing problem with time windows. © 2016 INFORMS.","Healthcare transportation; Iterated local search; Manpower planning; Pickup and delivery problem with time windows; Variable neighborhood descent","Ambulances; Computational complexity; Health care; Heuristic methods; Hospitals; Local search (optimization); Pickups; Planning; Scheduling; Vehicle routing; Backtracking algorithm; Iterated local search; Manpower planning; Pick-up and delivery service; Pickup and delivery problem with time windows; Transportation services; Variable neighborhood descents; Vehicle routing problem with time windows; Constraint satisfaction problems",,,,,"Alonso, F., Alvarez, M.J., Beasley, J.E., A tabu search algorithm for the periodic vehicle routing problem with multiple vehicle trips and accessibility restrictions (2007) J.

Logistics companies with insufficient volume of transport capacities are forced to make a selection of customers that they can integrate efficiently into their tours. This is of particular relevance in the pickup and delivery market, where shipments from several different customers can be moved on the same vehicle. In the literature, however, the problem of customer selection has not been applied for the given class of pickup and delivery problems so far. We want to fill this gap by introducing the multi-vehicle profitable pickup and delivery problem (MVPPDP), where multiple carriers transport goods from a selection of pickup customers to the corresponding delivery customers within given travel time limits. For this problem, we propose a method based on general variable neighborhood search (GVNS). We conduct experiments with two different variants of this method, namely a sequential (GVNSseq) and a self-adaptive (GVNSsa) version. Additionally, we compare it to an algorithm based on Guided Local Search (GLS), which is known to find good solutions for related problems very fast. The performance of these methods is examined on the basis of data instances with up to 1000 customer requests. In an experimental study, we observe that both variants of GVNS with 11 neighborhoods outperform GLS with regard to solution quality for all sizes of test instances. However, for medium sized and large instances, GLS shows an advantage in average runtimes. © 2016, The Author(s).","Metaheuristics; Pickup and delivery; Profitable tour problem",,,,,,"Ackermann, H., Ewe, H., Kopfer, H., Küfer, K.H., Böse, J.W., Hao, H., Carlos, C., Voss, S., Combinatorial auctions in freight logistics (2011) Computational Logistics, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 6971, pp. 1-17. , Springer, Berlin; Archetti, C., Bianchessi, N., Speranza, M.G., Optimal solutions for routing problems with profits (2013) Discrete Appl Math, 161 (45), pp. 547-557; Archetti, C., Feillet, D., Hertz, A., Speranza, M.G., The capacitated team orienteering and profitable tour problems (2009) J Oper Res Soc, 60 (6), pp. 831-842; Archetti, C., Hertz, A., Speranza, M.G., Metaheuristics for the team orienteering problem (2007) J Heuristics, 13 (1), pp. 49-76; Archetti, C., Speranza, M.G., Vigo, D., Toth, P., Vigo, D., Vehicle routing problems with profits (2014) Vehicle routing: problems, methods, and applications, pp. 273-297. , MOS-SIAM series on optimization, Philadelphia; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Dynamic pickup and delivery problems (2010) Eur J Oper Res, 202 (1), pp. 8-15; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Gribkovskaia, I., Laporte, G., Static pickup and delivery problems: a classification scheme and survey (2007) Top, 15 (1), pp. 1-31; Bolduc, M., Renaud, J., Boctor, F., Laporte, G., A perturbation metaheuristic for the vehicle routing problem with private fleet and common carriers (2008) J Oper Res Soc, 59, pp. 776-787; Boussier, S., Feillet, D., Gendreau, M., (2007) An exact algorithm for team orienteering problems. 4OR, 5 (3), pp. 211-230; Butt, S.E., Cavalier, T.M., A heuristic for the multiple tour maximum collection problem (1994) Comput Oper Res, 21 (1), pp. 101-111; Chao, I.-M., Golden, B.L., Wasil, E.A., The team orienteering problem (1996) Eur J Oper Res, 88 (3), pp. 464-474; Chbichib, A., Mellouli, R., Chabchoub, H., Profitable vehicle routing problem with multiple trips: Modeling and variable neighborhood descent algorithm (2012) Am J Oper Res, 2 (6), pp. 104-119; Chu, C.-W., A heuristic algorithm for the truckload and less-than-truckload problem (2005) Eur J Oper Res, 165 (3), pp. 657-667; Croes, G.A., A method for solving traveling-salesman problems (1958) Oper Res, 6 (6), pp. 791-812; Dahl, S., Derigs, U., Cooperative planning in express carrier networks an empirical study on the effectiveness of a real-time decision support system (2011) Decis Support Syst, 51 (3), pp. 620-626; Dang, D.C., Guibadj, R., Moukrim, A., Di Chio, C., Brabazon, A., Di Caro, G.A., Drechsler, R., Uyar, A.S., A pso-based memetic algorithm for the team orienteering problem (2011) Applications of Evolutionary Computation, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 6625, pp. 471-480. , Springer, Berlin; Ergun, O., Kuyzu, G., Savelsbergh, M.W.P., Reducing truckload transportation costs through collaboration (2007) Trans Sci, 41 (2), pp. 206-221; Ergun, O., Kuyzu, G., Savelsbergh, M.W.P., Shipper collaboration (2007) Comput Oper Res, 34, pp. 1551-1560; Feillet, D., Dejax, P., Gendreau, M., Traveling salesman problems with profits (2005) Trans Sci, 39 (2), pp. 188-205; Gribkovskaia, I., Laporte, G., Shyshou, A., The single vehicle routing problem with deliveries and selective pickups (2008) Comput Oper Res, 35 (9), pp. 2908-2924; Hansen, P., Mladenović, N., Pérez, J.A.M., (2008) Variable neighbourhood search: methods and applications. 4OR, 6 (4), pp. 319-360; Hartl, R.F., Romauch, M., Moreno-Daz, R., Pichler, F., Quesada-Arencibia, A., The influence of routing on lateral transhipment (2013) Computer Aided Systems Theory—EUROCAST 2013.

We are given a set of requests and a homogeneous fleet of vehicles. A set of routes of minimum total length has to be determined such that each request is transported from a loading site to the corresponding unloading site. In the 3L-PDP, each request is given as a set of 3D rectangular items (boxes) and the vehicle capacity is replaced by a 3D loading space. We investigate which constraints will ensure that no reloading effort will occur, i.e. that no box is moved after loading and before unloading. A spectrum of 3L-PDP variants is introduced with different characteristics in terms of reloading effort. We propose a hybrid algorithm for solving the 3L-PDP consisting of a routing and a packing procedure. The routing procedure modifies a well-known large neighborhood search for the 1D-PDP. A tree search heuristic is responsible for packing boxes. Computational experiments were carried out using 54 newly proposed 3L-PDP benchmark instances. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Efficient ridesharing solutions could help mitigate congestion. Some of the actions that government agencies have taken to encourage ridesharing include the availability of high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes and existing policies of discounted toll rates on HOVs. These measures encourage ridesharing by reducing costs or travel times of such trips. To study how the optimal routes change as a function of incentives for ridesharing, we modified existing pickup and delivery problems with time windows to consider changes in passenger travel time and toll cost due to vehicle load. Our computational results explore how the total route cost and time are affected by the use of HOV lanes and toll savings. In addition, our results show that it can be beneficial from a time and cost perspective to take detours to pick up additional passengers and use HOV lanes when the time saving on HOV lanes is significant. © 2016 W.

Yet, the problem characteristics and assumptions vary widely and few literature reviews have made an effort to classify the existing articles accordingly. In this article, we present a taxonomic review of the VRP literature published between 2009 and June 2015. Based on an adapted version of an existing comprehensive taxonomy, we classify 277 articles and analyze the trends in the VRP literature.

Due to the complexity of the problem, which is NP-hard, we propose an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) heuristic algorithm to solve the PDPTW-SL. Complex aspects such as fixed lines' schedules, synchronization and time-windows constraints are efficiently considered in the proposed algorithm. Results of extensive computational experiments show that the ALNS is highly effective in finding good-quality solutions on the generated PDPTW-SL instances with up to 100 freight requests that reasonably represent real life situations. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

One of these restrictions is the limited battery capacity which makes detours to recharging stations necessary, thus requiring efficient tour planning mechanisms in order to sustain the competitiveness of electric vehicles compared to conventional vehicles. We introduce the Electric Fleet Size and Mix Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Recharging Stations (E-FSMFTW) to model decisions to be made with regards to fleet composition and the actual vehicle routes including the choice of recharging times and locations. The available vehicle types differ in their transport capacity, battery size and acquisition cost. Furthermore, we consider time windows at customer locations, which is a common and important constraint in real-world routing and planning problems. We solve this problem by means of branch-and-price as well as proposing a hybrid heuristic, which combines an Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search with an embedded local search and labeling procedure for intensification. By solving a newly created set of benchmark instances for the E-FSMFTW and the existing single vehicle type benchmark using an exact method as well, we show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We consider MRPWT from the viewpoint of robotics and incorporate practical factory application constraints in the transportation method design. The proposed MRPWT approach is a two-level hybrid planning method, consisting of an incidental delivery based single robot level planner and a simulated annealing based robot group level planner. Each robot resolves its individual transportation plan incidentally to reduce the transportation cost, whereas the group level planner utilizes predefined random actions to search the task assignment solution space and then incorporates the simulated annealing algorithm to resolve the MRPWT problem as a combinatorial optimization problem. By implementing a distributed auction mechanism, the proposed MRPWT approach can be further extended to resolve the online task allocation or reallocation problem in dynamic environments. Experiments performed on a group of mobile robots successfully demonstrate the effectiveness and the practical applicability of the proposed MRPWT approach for factory automated material and product deliveries. © 2015 IEEE.","Incidental delivery; multirobot pairwised transportation (MRPWT); simulated annealing","Combinatorial optimization; Industrial robots; Optimization; Robot programming; Robots; Simulated annealing; Transportation; Automated materials; Combinatorial optimization problems; Distributed Auctions; Dynamic environments; Simulated annealing algorithms; Transportation method; Transportation plans; Transportation problem; Materials handling",,,,,"Li, H., Tsukada, M., Nashashibi, F., Parent, M., Multivehicle cooperative local mapping: A methodology based on occupancy grid map merging (2014) IEEE Trans.

This paper addresses the related vehicle routing problem by using only electric vehicles (EVs) and by introducing the recharging stations (RSs). The problem is formulated as a multi-objective mixed integer linear model for minimising the total travel distance, the total cost for the EVs used and the total penalty cost for the unsatisfied time windows. In addition, length constraints on the routes are imposed in order to include several aspects such as the limited availability of the RSs. The weighted sum method is adopted and, to properly set the weights, three methods, derived from the analytical hierarchical process, are compared. Computational experiments on some instances are carried out, in order to assess the behaviour of our approach in terms of solution quality. © Copyright 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","AHP; Analytical hierarchical process; Electric vehicle routing; Multi-objective mathematical programming; Weighted sum method; WSM",,,,,,"Alvarenga, G.B., Mateus, G.R., De Tomi, G., A genetic and set partitioning two-phase approach for the vehicle routing problem with time windows (2007) Computers and Operations Research, 34 (6), pp. 1561-1584; Ambrosini, M., Caruso, T., Foresti, S., Righini, G., A GRASP for the pickup and delivery problem with rear loading (2004) Technical Report Note del Polo - Ricerca, (65). , DTI, University of Milan; Baldacci, R., Mingozzi, A., Roberti, R., Recent exact algorithms for solving the vehicle routing problem under capacity and time window constraints (2012) European Journal of Operational Research, 218 (1), pp. 1-6; Bard, F.J., Kontoravdis, G., Yu, G., A branch-and-cut procedure for the vehicle routing problem with time windows (2002) Transportation Science, 36 (2), pp. 250-269; Bent, R., Van Hentenryck, P., A two-stage hybrid algorithm for pickup and delivery vehicle routing problems with time windows (2006) Computers and Operations Research, 33 (4), pp. 875-893; Chen, H.K., Hsueh, C.F., Chang, M.S., An efficient algorithm for the time-dependent vehicle routing problem with time-windows (2002) The International Conference on Intercity Transportation, pp. 370-379. , Beijing, China, 5-7 November; Chen, X., Wan, W.S., Xu, X.H., The real-time time-dependent vehicle routing problem (2006) Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 42 (5), pp. 383-408; Cohon, J.L., (1978) Multiobjective Programming and Planning, , Acad.

This paper first proposes a new time-discretized multi-commodity network flow model for the VRPPDTW based on the integration of vehicles' carrying states within space-time transportation networks, so as to allow a joint optimization of passenger-to-vehicle assignment and turn-by-turn routing in congested transportation networks. Our three-dimensional state-space-time network construct is able to comprehensively enumerate possible transportation states at any given time along vehicle space-time paths, and further allows a forward dynamic programming solution algorithm to solve the single vehicle VRPPDTW problem. By utilizing a Lagrangian relaxation approach, the primal multi-vehicle routing problem is decomposed to a sequence of single vehicle routing sub-problems, with Lagrangian multipliers for individual passengers' requests being updated by sub-gradient-based algorithms. We further discuss a number of search space reduction strategies and test our algorithms, implemented through a specialized program in C++, on medium-scale and large-scale transportation networks, namely the Chicago sketch and Phoenix regional networks. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Forward dynamic programming; Lagrangian relaxation; Ride-sharing service optimization; Time-dependent least-cost path problem; Vehicle routing problem with pickup and delivery with time windows","C++ (programming language); Complex networks; Computer software; Lagrange multipliers; Network routing; Optimization; Pickups; Routing algorithms; Software testing; Time sharing systems; Transportation; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; LaGrangian relaxation; Large-scale transportation; Least cost path; Multi-commodity network flow models; Pick-up and delivery service; Pickup and delivery; Service optimization; Vehicle Routing Problems; Dynamic programming; algorithm; congestion; Lagrangian analysis; network analysis; optimization; transportation system",,,,,"Alfa, A.S., Scheduling of vehicles for transportation of elderly (1986) Transportation Planning and Technology, 11, pp. 203-212; Azi, N., Gendreau, M., Potvin, J.Y., An exact algorithm for a single vehicle routing problem with time windows and multiple routes (2007) European Journal of Operational Research, 178 (3), pp. 755-766; Baldacci, R., Bartolini, E., Mingozzi, A., An exact algorithm for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2011) Operations Research, 59 (2), pp. 414-426; Bell, W., Dalberto, L., Fisher, M.L., Greenfield, A., Jaikumar, R., Kedia, P., Mack, R., Prutzman, P., Improving the distribution of industrial gases with an on-line computerized routing and scheduling optimizer (1983) Interfaces, 13, pp. 4-23; Bellman, R., Dynamic programming treatment of the traveling salesman problem (1962) Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery, 9, pp. 61-63; Bodin, L.D., Sexton, T., The multi-vehicle subscriber dial-a-ride problem (1986) TIMS Studies in the Management Sciences, 22, pp. 73-86; Bramel, J., Simchi-Levi, D., A location based heuristic for general routing problems (1995) Operations Research, 43, pp. 649-660; Chabini, I., Discrete dynamic shortest path problems in transportation applications: Complexity and algorithms with optimal run time (1998) Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board, 1645, pp. 170-175; Chandra, R., Menon, R., Dagum, L., Kohr, D., Maydan, D., McDonald, J., (2000) Parallel Programming in OpenMP, , Morgan Kaufmann; Christiansen, M., Decomposition of a combined inventory routing and time constrained ship routing problem (1999) Transportation Science, 33, pp. 3-16; Cordeau, J.F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54 (3), pp. 573-586; Cullen, F., Jarvis, J., Ratliff, D., Set partitioning based heuristics for interactive routing (1981) Networks, 11, pp. 125-144; Desaulniers, G., Desrosiers, J., Erdmann, A., Solomon, M.M., Soumis, F., The VRP with pickup and delivery (2002) The Vehicle Routing Problem, SIAM Monographs on Discrete Mathematics and Applications, Chapter 9, pp. 225-242. , SIAM, Philadelphia, P.

Each stack is rear-loaded and is operated in a last-in-first-out (LIFO) fashion, meaning that when an item is picked up, it is positioned at the rear of a stack. An item can only be delivered if it is in that position. This problem arises in the transportation of heavy or dangerous material where unnecessary handling should be avoided, such as in the transportation of cars between car dealers and the transportation of livestock from farms to slaughterhouses. To solve this problem, we propose two different branch-price-and-cut algorithms. The first solves the shortest path pricing problem with the multi-stack policy, while the second incorporates this policy partly in the shortest path pricing problem and generates additional inequalities to the master problem when infeasible multi-stack routes are encountered. Computational results obtained on instances derived from benchmark instances for the pickup and delivery traveling salesman problem with multiple stacks are reported, and reveal the advantage of incorporating the multi-stack policy in the pricing problem. Instances with up to 75 requests and with one, two and three stacks can be solved optimally within 2 hours of computational time. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Both the overall job completion time and number of drivers utilized are analyzed for the automated job allocations and manual job assignments from transportation field experts. Design/methodology/approach – A nested genetic algorithm (GA) is used to automate the job allocation process and minimize the overall time to deliver all jobs, while utilizing the fewest number of drivers – as a secondary objective. Findings – Three different real world data sets were used to compare the results of the GA vs transportation field experts’ manual assignments. The job assignments from the GA improved the overall job completion time in 100 percent (30/30) of the cases and maintained the same or fewer drivers as BS Logistics (BSL) in 47 percent (14/30) of the cases. Originality/value – This paper provides a novel approach to solving a real world VRP that has multiple variants. While there have been numerous models to capture a select number of these variants, the value of this nested GA lies in its ability to incorporate multiple depots, a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles as well as varying pickup times, pickup locations, delivery times and delivery locations for each job into a single model.

Applications of the PDPLC arise in healthcare transportation where the objective function is customer-centric or service-based. In the branch-and-price algorithm, we devise an ad hoc label-setting algorithm to solve the pricing problem and employ the bounded bidirectional search strategy to accelerate the label-setting algorithm. The proposed algorithms were tested on a set of instances generated by a common data generator in the literature. The computational results showed that the branch-and-price algorithm outperformed the branch-and-cut algorithm by a large margin, and can solve instances with 40 requests to optimality in a reasonable time frame. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Branch-and-cut;

Locations provide a number of cumulative resources that are utilized by vehicles either during service (e.g., forklifts) or for the entirety of their visit (e.g., parking bays). Locations can become congested if insufficient resources are available, upon which vehicles must wait until a resource becomes available before proceeding. The problem is challenging from a computational standpoint since it incorporates the vehicle routing problem and the resource-constrained project scheduling problem. The main contribution of this paper is a branch-and-price-and-check model that uses a branch-and-price algorithm that solves the underlying vehicle routing problem, and a constraint programming subproblem that checks the feasibility of the location resource constraints, and then adds combinatorial nogood cuts to the master problem if the resource constraints are violated. Experimental results show the benefits of the branch-and-price-and-check approach.

We solved this model to optimality using an exact Branch-and-Price method, which is based on previous work. To study the performance of the solution method and its refinements, we conducted extensive computational experiments. We also applied the proposed model and method to a relevant logistic system and investigated its performance under various conditions.

Given a set of cargoes with pickup, delivery ports, and time windows, the problem determines how to route a fleet of heterogeneous ships to carry the cargoes. The cargoes can be split to be served by multiple ships if their time window is not violated. In addition, a ship can handle multiple cargoes within a route. The fleet of heterogeneous ships consists of two types of ships: company-owned ships and tramp ships. Each of both types consists of heterogeneous ships with different capacities. A company-owned ship can deliver cargoes from multiple supply ports to multiple delivery ports within a route, whereas a tramp ship can deliver a cargo directly from a supply port to a delivery port within a route. To reduce operation cost, the two types of the ships should be well coordinated and utilized. A mixed integer programming model for the problem is presented, and an adaptive large neighborhood search-based heuristic is proposed. Thirty benchmark problems are generated and categorized into three groups according to the number of vessels and cargoes. Computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The LIFO loading rule ensures that no handling is required prior to unloading an item from a vehicle: a linear stack loading structure is maintained and an item can only be delivered if it is the last one in the stack. Three exact branch-price-and-cut algorithms are proposed for this problem. The first incorporates the LIFO constraints in the master problem. The second one handles the LIFO constraints directly in the shortest path pricing problem. It applies a dynamic programming algorithm relying on an ad hoc dominance criterion. The third algorithm is a hybrid between the first two methods. Known valid inequalities are adapted to the PDPTWL and the impact of different path relaxations on the total computation time is investigated. Computational results obtained on instances derived from known instances of the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (PDPTW) are reported. © 2015 INFORMS.","Branch-price-and-cut; Column generation; Last-in-first-out loading; Valid inequalities; Vehicle routing with pickup and delivery","Algorithms; Costs; Crashworthiness; Dynamic programming; Linear programming; Pickups; Unloading; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Branch-price-and-cut; Column generation; Last in first outs; Pickup and delivery; Valid inequality; Loading",,,,,"Baldacci, R., Bartolini, E., Mingozzi, A., An exact algorithm for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2011) Oper.

The vehicle carries a container divided into stacks of fixed height, each following a Last-In-First-Out policy, and the aim is to perform pickups and deliveries by minimizing the total routing cost and ensuring a feasible loading/unloading of the vehicle. A realistic generalization of the DTSPMS arises when a single vehicle is not enough to collect all products, and therefore multiple, and possibly heterogeneous vehicles are needed to perform the transportation operations. This paper introduces and formulates this generalization, that we refer as the Double Vehicle Routing Problem with Multiple Stacks. It proposes three models, the first one based on a three-index formulation and solved by a branch-and-cut algorithm, and the other two based on two set partitioning formulations using different families of columns and solved by a branch-and-price and a branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm, respectively. The performance of these algorithms has been studied on a wide family of benchmark test instances, observing that, although the branch-and-cut algorithm shows a better performance on instances with a small number of vehicles, the performance of the branch-and-price and the branch-and-price-and-cut algorithms improves as the number of vehicles grows. Additionally, the first set partitioning formulation yields tighter lower bounds, but the second formulation, because of its simplicity, provides better convergence properties, solving instances with up to fifty vertices to proven optimality. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

LIFO loading minimizes handling while unloading items from the vehicle: the items are loaded according to a linear stack structure, and an item can only be delivered if it is the one on top of the stack. Three exact branch-price-and-cut algorithms are available for this problem. These can solve instances with up to 75 requests within one hour. We propose a population-based metaheuristic capable of handling larger instances much faster. First, a set of initial solutions is generated with a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure. For each of these solutions, local search is applied in order to first decrease the total number of vehicles and then the total traveled distance. Two different strategies are used to create offspring. The first selects vehicle routes from the solution pool. The second selects two parents to create an offspring with a crossover operator. For both strategies, local search is then performed on the child solution. Finally, the offspring is added to the population and the best survivors are kept. The population is managed so as to maintain good quality solutions with respect to total cost and population diversity. Computational results on medium to large instances confirm the effectiveness of the proposed metaheuristic. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The fleet is assumed to be heterogeneous with a novel feature that allows the vehicles to be configured before service begins to handle various types of demand. The work was motivated by a daily route planning problem arising at a senior activity center. A fleet of configurable vans is available each day to transport participants to and from the center, as well as to secondary facilities for rehabilitative and medical treatment. The number of participants and support equipment that a van can accommodate depends on how it is configured. An exact method is introduced based on branch and price and cut. At each node in the search tree, the master problem is solved by column generation to find a lower bound. To improve the bound, subset-row inequalities are applied to the variables of the master problem. Columns are generated by solving the pricing subproblems with a labeling algorithm enhanced by new dominance conditions. Local search on the current set of columns is used to quickly find promising additions. Implementation details and ways to improve the performance of the overall procedure are discussed. Testing was done on a set of real instances as well as a set of randomly generated instances with up to 50 customer requests. The results show that optimal solutions are obtained in the majority of cases. © 2015 INFORMS.","Branch and price and cut; Configurable vehicle capacity; Dial-a-ride problem; Heterogeneous vehicles; Pickup and delivery problem","Algorithms; Cabs (truck); Costs; Fleet operations; Linear programming; Pickups; Trucks; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Branch-and-price-and-cut; Dial-a-ride problem; Heterogeneous vehicles; Pickup and delivery problems; Vehicle capacity; Integer programming",,,,,"Alexandrescu, A., (2001) Modern CCC Design: Generic Programming and Design Patterns Applied, , Addison-Wesley, Boston; Baldacci, R., Bartolini, E., Mingozzi, A., An exact algorithm for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2011) Oper.

Box 116595, Gainesville, FL, United States","In the static elevator dispatching problem the aim is to design a route for each capacitated elevator to satisfy a set of transportation requests such that a cost function is minimized while satisfying a number of constraints. This problem is a crucial part in the control of an elevator group. So far, the problem has been formulated in various algorithmic-dependent forms, where part of the constraints have been given only verbally. In this paper we present a mixed-integer linear programming formulation of the problem where all constraints are given in explicit mathematical form. This allows, e.g., polyhedral analysis of the problem. We also present some new valid inequalities to strengthen the formulation. Furthermore, we study the polyhedral structure of the problem in a generic case arising in the down-peak traffic pattern. In particular, we show which equalities define a minimal equality system for the polytope of the problem, which is defined as the convex hull of the feasible solutions. In addition, we provide the dimension of the polytope and analyze which valid inequalities derived are facet inducing. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Elevator dispatching problem; Polyhedral results; Routing; Valid inequalities","Cost functions; Elevators; Integer programming; Transportation routes; Dispatching problem; Mathematical forms; Mixed integer linear programming; Polyhedral analysis; Polyhedral results; Polyhedral structures; Routing; Valid inequality; Constraint satisfaction problems",,,,,"Archetti, C., Savelsbergh, M.W.P., Speranza, M.G., To split or not to split: that is the question (2008) Transp Res Part E, 44, pp. 114-123; Ascheuer, N., Fischetti, M., Grötschel, M., A polyhedral study of the asymmetric traveling salesman problem with time windows (2000) Networks, 36 (2), pp. 69-79; Balas, E., Fischetti, M., Pulleyblank, W.R., The precedence-constrained asymmetric traveling salesman polytope (1995) Math Program, 68, pp. 241-265; Carrabs, F., Cerulli, R., Cordeau, J.F., An additive branch-and-bound algorithm for the pickup and delivery traveling salesman problem with lifo or fifo loading (2007) Inf Syst Oper Res, 45, pp. 223-238; Dantzig, G.B., Fulkerson, D.R., Johnson, S.M., Solution of a large scale traveling salesman problem (1954) Oper Res, 2, pp. 393-410; Desrochers, M., Desrosiers, J., Solomon, M., A new optimization algorithm for the vehicle routing problem with time windows (1992) Oper Res, 40, pp. 342-354; Hiller, B., (2009) Online optimization: probabilistic analysis and algorithm engineering, , PhD thesis, TU Berlin:; Hiller, B., Tuchscherer, A., Kalcsics, J., Nickel, S., Real-time destination-call elevator group control on embedded microcontrollers (2008) Operations research proceedings, pp. 357-362; Hirasawa, K., Eguchi, T., Zhou, J., Yu, L., Hu, J., Markon, S., A double-deck elevator group supervisory control system using genetic network programming (2008) IEEE Trans Syst Man Cybern C Appl Rev, 38 (4), pp. 535-550; Ho, M., Robertson, B., Elevator group supervisory control using fuzzy logic.

The most prevalent context of dynamic time windows is when precedence is given for the two operations so that it is a priori specified that one operation must take place before the other. A prominent vehicle routing problem with dynamic time windows and precedence is the dial-a-ride problem (DARP), where user-specified transportation requests from origin to destination points must be serviced. The paper presents a new branch-and-cut-and-price solution approach for the DARP, the prototypical vehicle-routing problem with ordinary and dynamic time windows. For the first time (to our knowledge), both ordinary and dynamic time windows are handled in the column-generation subproblem. For the solution, an effective column-generation pricing procedure is derived that allows fast shortest-path computations due to new dominance rules. The new approach is compared with alternative column-generation algorithms that handle dynamic time windows either as constraints of the master program or with less effective labeling procedures. Computational experiments indicate the superiority of the new approach. © 2015 INFORMS.","Branch-and-price; Dial-a-ride problem; Dynamic time windows; Labeling algorithm; Ride-time constraints; Time synchronization; Transportation; Vehicle routing","Costs; Integer programming; Linear programming; Network routing; Routing algorithms; Transportation; Vehicles; Branch and price; Dial-a-ride problem; Dynamic time; Labeling algorithms; Time constraints; Time synchronization; Vehicle routing",,,,,"Ascheuer, N., Fischetti, M., Grötschel, M., A polyhedral study of the asymmetric traveling salesman problem with time windows (2000) Networks, 36 (2), pp. 69-79; Azi, N., Gendreau, M., Potvin, J.-Y., An exact algorithm for a vehicle routing problem with time windows and multiple use of vehicles (2010) Eur.

First, it overcomes symmetry issues observed in a formulation coming from a previous study of the problem. Second, it is strengthened with several classes of valid inequalities. As a result, the branch-and-cut-and-price implementation compares favorably with previous exact solution approaches for the problem-namely, two branch-and-price algorithms and a branch-and-cut method. Overall, 10 new optimality certificates and 8 new best upper bounds are provided in this study.

Users place transportation requests, specifying a pickup location, a delivery location, and a time window for either of the two. Based on maximum user ride time considerations, the second time window is generated. A given fleet of vehicles, each with a certain capacity, is available to serve these requests, and maximum route duration constraints have to be respected. Each request is associated with a revenue and the objective is to maximize the total profit, that is, the total revenue minus the total costs. Transportation requests involving several persons may be split if it is beneficial to do so. We formulate the DARPSRP as a mixed-integer program using position variables and in terms of a path-based formulation. For the solution of the latter, we design a branch-and-price algorithm. The largest instance solved to optimality, when applied to available instances from the literature, has 40 requests; when applied to newly generated instances, the largest instance solved to optimality consists of 24 requests. To solve larger instances a variable neighborhood search algorithm is developed. We investigate the impact of request splitting under different geographical settings, assuming favorable settings for request splitting in terms of the number of people per request. The largest benefits from request splitting are obtained for problem settings exhibiting clustered customer locations. © 2015 INFORMS.","Branch-and-price; Pickup and delivery; Split requests; Variable neighborhood search","Costs; Crashworthiness; Fleet operations; Optimization; Pickups; Profitability; Vehicle routing; Branch and price; Branch-and-price algorithms; Dial-a-ride problem; Mixed-integer programs; Pickup and delivery; Position variables; Split requests; Variable neighborhood search; Integer programming",,,,,"Almada-Lobo, B., Oliveira, J.F., Carravilla, M.A., Production planning and scheduling in the glass container industry: A VNS approach (2008) Internat.

The problem is inspired by a real life ship routing and scheduling problem from a sub-segment of shipping known as project shipping. What is unique about this subsegment is that they transport unique and specialized cargoes, that make stowage onboard the ships complex, and thus must be considered when creating routes and schedules for the ships. To solve this problem we propose a branch-and-price method, including a novel way of solving the subproblems using a labeling algorithm. To speed up the solution process we relax some of the restrictions in the subproblem, giving us a simpler subproblem that may produce infeasible paths. The computational results show the branch-and-price method provides optimal solutions to many instances previously unsolved by the literature, and that it is competitive with the tabu search heuristic for many instances. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Branch-and-price; Maritime transportation; Stowage; Vehicle routing","Cargo handling; Costs; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Integer programming; Navigation; Scheduling; Ships; Stowage (mines); Tabu search; Transportation routes; Vehicle routing; Waterway transportation; Branch and price; Computational results; Labeling algorithms; Maritime transportation; Optimal solutions; Pickup and delivery problem with time windows; Routing and scheduling; Tabu Search heuristic; Problem solving",,,,,"Andersson, H., Duesund, J., Fagerholt, K., Ship routing and scheduling with cargo coupling and synchronization constraints (2011) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 61 (4), pp. 1107-1164; Barnhart, C., Johnson, E.L., Nemhauser, G.L., Savelsbergh, M.P.W., Vance, P.H., Branch-and-price: Column generation for solving huge integer programs (1998) Operations Research, 46 (3), pp. 316-329; Brønmo, G., Nygreen, B., Lysgaard, J., Column generation approaches to ship scheduling with flexible cargo sizes (2010) European Journal of Operational Research, 200, pp. 139-150; Christiansen, M., Fagerholt, K., Nygreen, B., Ronen, D., Ship routing and scheduling in the new millennium (2013) European Journal of Operational Research, 228 (3), pp. 467-483; Dubrovsky, O., Levitin, G., Penn, M., A genetic algorithm with a compact solution encoding for the container ship stowage problem (2002) Journal of Heuristics, 8 (6), pp. 585-599; Engineer, F., Furman, K., Nemhauser, G., Savelsbergh, M., Song, J., A branchprice-and-cut algorithm for single-product maritime inventory routing (2012) Operations Research, 60 (1), pp. 106-122; Fagerholt, K., Hvattum, L.M., Johnsen, T.A.V., Korsvik, J.E., Routing and scheduling in project shipping (2011) Annals of Operations Research, 36 (1), pp. 94-118; Lübbecke, M., Desrosiers, J., Selected topics in column generation (2005) Operations Research, 53 (6), pp. 1007-1023; Øvstebø, B.O., Hvattum, L.M., Fagerholt, K., Optimization of stowage plans for roro ships (2011) Computers & Operations Research, 38 (10), pp. 1425-1434; Røpke, S., Cordeau, J.F., Branch-and-cut-and-price for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2009) Transportation Science, 43 (3), pp. 267-286; Stålhane, M., Ersson, H., Christiansen, M., Cordeau, J.F., Desaulniers, G., A branch-price-and-cut method for a ship routing and scheduling problem with split loads (2012) Computers & Operations Research, 39, pp. 3361-3375; Stålhane, M., Ersson, H., Christiansen, M., A branch-and-price method for a ship routing and scheduling problem with cargo coupling and synchronization constraints (2014) EURO Journal on Transportation and Logistics, pp. 1-23. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13676-014-0061-5; Steenken, D., Winter, T., Zimmermann, U., Stowage and transport optimization in ship planning (2001) Online Optimization of Large Scale Systems, pp. 731-745. , In: Grtschel, M., Krumke, S., Rambau, J.

Although Dial-a-ride Problems (DARP) have been discussed for several decades, most researchers have worked to develop algorithms with low computational cost under the minimal total travel costs, and fewer studies have considered how changes in travel time might affect the vehicle routes and service sequences. Ignoring such variations in travel time when design vehicle routes and schedules might lead to the production of inefficient vehicle routes, as well as incorrect actual vehicle arrival times at the related nodes. The purpose of this paper is to construct a DARP formulation with consideration of time-dependent travel times and utilizes the traffic simulation software, DynaTAIWAN, to simulate the real traffic conditions in order to obtain the time-dependent travel time matrices. The branch-and-price approach is introduced for the time-dependent DARP and tested by examining the sub-network of Kaohsiung City, Taiwan. The numerical results reveal that the length of the time window can significantly affect the vehicle routes and quantitative measurements. As the length of the time window increases, the objective value and the number of vehicles will reduce significantly. However, the CPU time, the average pickup delay time, the average delivery delay time and the average actual ride time (ART)/direct ride time (DRT) will increase significantly as the length of the time window increases. Designing the vehicle routes to reduce operating costs and satisfy the requirements of customers is a difficult task, and a trade-off must be made between these goals.

The task is to find a set of minimum-cost routes satisfying pairing and precedence, capacities, and time windows. Additionally, temporal synchronization constraints couple the service times at the pickup and delivery locations of the customer requests in the following way: a request has to be delivered within prespecified minimum and maximum time lags (called ride times) after it has been picked up. The presence of these ride-time constraints severely complicates the subproblem of the natural column-generation formulation of the SPDP so that it is not clear if their integration into the subproblem pays off in an integer column-generation approach. Therefore, we develop four branch-and-cut-and-price algorithms for the SPDP based on column-generation formulations that use different subproblems. Two of these subproblems are considered for the first time in this paper have not been studied before. We derive new dominance rules and labeling algorithms for their effective solution. Extensive computational results indicate that integrating either both types of ride-time constraints or only the maximum ride-time constraints into the subproblem results in the strongest overall approach. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Association of European Operational Research Societies (EURO) withinthe International Federation of Operational Research Societies (IFORS).

The proposed matheuristic is based on a dual ascent procedure applied to an extended set covering model (SCC) and on a randomized constructive heuristic. It starts by constructing an initial set of feasible solutions. The corresponding routes are the starting subset of columns of SCC. At each iteration, the dual ascent based on a Lagrangian optimization of the SCC computes a near-optimal dual solution that is returned along with a primal solution obtained by a Lagrangian heuristic. The dual costs are used for generating new feasible solutions by means of the constructive heuristic, and the corresponding routes are the new columns added to the SCC. At the end of the algorithm, the best heuristic solution is pruned to get a feasible solution for the city logistics problem. The matheuristic could actually solve different city logistics scenarios to be used as a basis for a successive stakeholders concertation process. A further interesting byproduct of this research is the dual ascent procedure that also proved effective on the classical set covering problem, in addition to its extension considered in this paper. © 2014 The Authors.","City logistics; Dual ascent; Lagrangian relaxation; Matheuristics; Set covering problem","Algorithms; Fleet operations; Iterative methods; Lagrange multipliers; Optimization; Vehicle routing; City logistics; Dual ascent; LaGrangian relaxation; Matheuristics; Set covering problem; Logistics",,,,,"Ahlem, C., Racem, M., Habib, C., Profitable vehicle routing problem with multiple trips: modeling and variable neighborhood descent algorithm (2012) American Journal of Operational Research, 2 (6), pp. 104-119; Balas, E., Carrera, M.C., A dynamic subgradient-based branch-and-bound procedure for the set covering (1996) Operations Research, 44, pp. 875-890; Baldacci, R., Bartolini, E., Mingozzi, A., An exact algorithm for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2011) Operations Research, 59 (2), pp. 414-426; Baldacci, R., Christofides, N., Mingozzi, A., An exact algorithm for the vehicle routing problem based on the set partitioning formulation with additional cuts (2008) Mathematical Programming, 115 (2), pp. 351-385; Beasley, J.E., OR-Library: distributing test problems by electronic mail (1990) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 41 (11), pp. 1069-1072; Beasley, J.E., (2013), http://people.brunel.ac.uk/mastjjb/jeb/orlib/scpinfo.html, OR-Library.

All of these features originate from practical applications in recent years. To formulate the problem, we propose two mathematical models that use different methods to deal with requests associated with the depot. To further strengthen the models, we propose eight families of valid inequalities, and based on them, we propose a branch-and-cut algorithm to solve the problem. The branch-and-cut algorithm was extensively tested on a set of instances generated according to the data of a real world application. The computational results showed that seven families of inequalities can improve the lower bounds substantially and the branch-and-cut algorithm can solve instances with up to 22 requests within 4 h. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Branch-and-cut;

The first leg visits only pickup points and ends at some delivery point. The second leg is a direct trip - called a shuttle - between two delivery points. This optimization problem has practical applications in the transportation of people between a large set of pickup points and a restricted set of delivery points. This paper proposes three mathematical models for the PDPS and a branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm to solve it. The pricing sub-problem, an Elementary Shortest Path Problem with Resource Constraints (ESPPRC), is solved with a labeling algorithm enhanced with efficient dominance rules. Three families of valid inequalities are used to strengthen the quality of linear relaxations. The method is evaluated on generated and real-world instances containing up to 193 transportation requests. Instances with up to 87 customers are solved to optimality within a computation time of one hour. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This paper proposes a two-phase mathematical programming model to formulate the liner hub-and-spoke shipping network design problem subject to the maritime cabotage legislations, i.e., the hub location and feeder allocation problem for phase I and the ship route design with ship fleet deployment problem for phase II. The problem in phase I is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming model. By developing a hub port expanding technique, the problem in phase II is formulated as a vehicle routing problem with pickup and delivery.

In the MTRPD, a fleet of identical vehicles is dispatched to serve a set of customers. Each vehicle that starts from and ends at the depot is not allowed to travel a distance longer than a predetermined limit and each customer must be visited exactly once. The objective is to minimize the total waiting time of all customers after the vehicles leave the depot. To optimally solve the MTRPD, we propose a new exact branch-and-price- and-cut algorithm, where the column generation pricing subproblem is a resource-constrained elementary shortest-path problem with cumulative costs. An ad hoc label-setting algorithm armed with bidirectional search strategy is developed to solve the pricing subproblem. Computational results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. The optimal solutions to 179 out of 180 test instances are reported in this paper. Our computational results serve as benchmarks for future researchers on the problem. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The problem is to find an optimal assignment and sequence and loading volume of demand simultaneously in order to minimize the total distance satisfying the capacity of tankers. The problem can be considered as a multi-product heterogeneous fleet split pickup ship routing problem with finite capacity and loading constraints. An efficient heuristic algorithm based on the column generation method is developed to generate a feasible solution taking into account of practical constraints.

Therefore, this paper proposes a method to convert the integer variables of a mixed integer programming problem into continuous variables. Then a mixed integer programming problem becomes an equivalent nonlinear programming problem or linear programming problem. And then, well developed nonlinear programming or linear programming solvers can be employed to efficiently and effectively search for the solution of a mixed integer programming problem. In addition to describing processes for converting integer variables into continuous ones, this paper provides two examples to demonstrate the conversion process and the benefits coming from the conversion methodology in the process of approaching the optimal solutions. Once the mixed integer programming is converted to an equivalent one where the decision variables are continuous, a nonlinear programming problem solver such as a differential evolutionary algorithm, can be used to solve the new equivalent problem. We show the procedure by solving a practical mixed integer programming problem that arises in a typical mechanical design problem. The result shows our solution is better than the ones from other four published mixed integer programming solvers. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg..","Combinatorial analysis; Combinatorial optimization; Evolutionary computations; Global optimization","Combinatorial optimization; Decision making; Evolutionary algorithms; Global optimization; Industrial engineering; Linear programming; Optimal systems; Optimization; Combinatorial analysis; Continuous variables; Differential evolutionary algorithm; Linear programming problem; Linear programming solvers; Mixed integer programming; Nonlinear programming problem; Optimization problems; Integer programming",,,,,"Frota, Y., Maculan, N., Noronha, T.F., Ribeiro, C.C., A branch-and-cut algorithm for partition coloring (2010) Networks - Network Optimization (INOC 2007), 55, pp. 194-204; Ropke, S., Cordeau, J.F., Branch and cut and price for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2009) Transp Sci, 43 (3), pp. 267-286; Santos, F.A., Mateus, G.R., Da Cunha, A.S., A branch-and-price algorithm for a vehicle routing problem with cross-docking (2011) Electron Notes Discrete Math, 37, pp. 249-254; Gwiazda, T.D., (2006) Genetic Algorithms Reference Vol. 1 Crossover for Single-objective Numerical Optimization Problems, , Tomasz Gwizada Press, Lomianki; Hong, C.C., Song, M., Optimal in silico target gene deletion through nonlinear programming for genetic engineering (2010) PLoS ONE, 5 (2), pp. e9331. , doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0009331; Lin, Y.C., Lin, Y.C., Huang, K.S., Su, K.L., An evolutionary Lagrange method for mechanical design (2011) Appl Mech Mater, 44-47, pp. 1817-1822; Ponsich, A., Coello Coello, C.A., Differential evolution performances for the solution of mixed-integer constrained process engineering problems (2011) Appl Soft Comput, 11, pp. 399-409. , doi:10.1016/j.asoc.2009.11.030; Boros, E., Hammer, P.L., Pseudo-Boolean optimization (2002) Discret Appl Math, 123, pp. 155-225; Bishop, E., A generalization of the Stone-Weierstrass theorem (1961) Pac J Math, 11 (3), pp. 777-783; Mevissen, M., (2007) Introduction to Concepts and Advances in Polynomial Optimization, , http://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/fukudak/semi/optpast/FS07/opt_abs/ PolynomialOptimization.pdf; Storn, R., Price, K., Differential evolution - A simple and efficient adaptive scheme for global optimization over continuous spaces (1995) Technical Report, ICSI, , http://http.icsi.berkeley.edu/~storn/litera.html; Lampinen, J., Zelinka, I., Mixed variable nonlinear optimization by differential evolution (1999) Proceedings of Nostradamus, 99 (2). , Paris; Sandgren, E., Nonlinear integer and discrete programming in mechanical design optimization (1990) ASME J Mech des, 112, pp. 223-229. , doi:10.1115/1.2912; Fu, J.F., Fenton, R.G., Cleghorn, W.L., A mixed integer-discrete-continuous programming method and its application to engineering design optimization (1991) Eng Optim, 17, pp. 236-280; Zhang, C., Wang, H.P., Mixed-discrete nonlinear optimization with simulated annealing (1993) Eng Optim, 21, pp. 277-291; Cao, Y.J., Wu, Q.H., Evolutionary programming (1997) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Evolutionary Computation, Indianapolis, pp. 443-446","Hong, C.-C.; Department of Industrial Management, National Pingtung University of Science and Technology, Neipu, Taiwan; email: chong@mail.npust.edu.tw",,"'Taiwan's Chinese Institute of Industrial Engineering';Chinese Industrial Engineering Institution (CIEI) of CMES;Heads in Greater China(CIEDHC);The Council of Industrial Engineering Department","springer berlin","4th International Asia Conference on Industrial Engineering and Management Innovation, IEMI 2013","18 July 2013 through 18 July 2013","Taipei",105192,,,,,"English","Proc.

Urban rail transit rolling stock assignment mathematical model aims to minimize the total operation cost with the relevant requirements. A hybrid column generation algorithm is designed to solve the model. The algorithm combines the branch-and-price algorithm with the large scale neighborhood search algorithm. The large scale neighborhood search algorithm is adopted to update a newly acquired initial integer solution. The integer solution is implemented as the new columns into the column generation algorithm to avoid the degenerate problem. Meanwhile, the newly acquired integer solution can update the upper bound of the branch-and-price search tree. Therefore, a more powerful upper bound is used to the branch-and-price search tree to speed up the algorithm process. Numerical results show that our approach can solve large-scale rolling stock assignment problems, and result in more effective solutions.","Column generation algorithm; Large-scale neighborhood search algorithm; Rolling stock assignment; Urban rail transit","Assignment problems; Branch-and-price algorithms; Column generation; Degenerate problems; Neighborhood search algorithms; Optimization modeling; Total operation costs; Urban rail transit; Costs; Forestry; Integer programming; Learning algorithms; Light rail transit; Railroad rolling stock; Trees (mathematics); Mathematical models; Algorithms; Costs; Forestry; Mathematical Models; Mathematics; Trees",,,,,"Christiansen, C.H., Lysgaard, J., A branch-and-price algorithm for the capacitated vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands (2007) Operations Research Letters, 35 (6), pp. 773-781; Ropke, S., Cordeau, J.-F., Branch and cut and price for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2009) Transportation Science, 43 (3), pp. 267-286; Baker, B.M., Ayechew, M.A., A genetic algorithm for the vehicle routing problem (2003) Computers and Operations Research, 30 (5), pp. 787-800; Bunte, S., Kliewe, N., An overview on vehicle scheduling models (2009) Public Transportation, 1 (4), pp. 299-317; Cordeau, J.-F., Soumis, F., Desrosiers, J., Simultaneous assignment of locomotives and cars to passenger trains (2001) Operations Research, 49 (4), pp. 531-548; Rouillon, S., Desaulniers, G., Soumis, F., An extended branch-and-bound method for locomotive assignment (2006) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 40 (5), pp. 404-423; Cacchiani, V., Caprara, A., Toth, P., Solving a real-world train-unit assignment problem (2010) Mathematical Programming, 124 (1), pp. 207-231; Wang, Y., Liu, J., Miao, J., Column generation algorithms based optimization method for maintenance scheduling of multiple units (2010) China Railway Science, 31 (2), pp. 115-120. , in Chinese; Qu, S., Xu, X., Scheduling model of multiple units on intercity railway (2010) Journal of Tongji University: Natural Science, 38 (9), pp. 1298-1302. , in Chinese; Zhang, C., Chen, J., Hua, W., Research on the EMU operation plan based on different maintenance capacity (2010) China Railway Science, 31 (5), pp. 130-133. , in Chinese; Cadarso, L., Mari'n, A., Robust rolling stock in rapid transit networks (2011) Computers & Operations Research, 38 (3), pp. 1131-1142; Xu, R., Chen, J., Du, S., Study on carrying capacity and use of rolling stock with multi-routing in urban rail transit (2005) Journal of the China Railway Society, 27 (4), pp. 6-10. , in Chinese; Li, J., Research on multiple depot vehicle scheduling problem of urban bus system based on the time-space network (2012), Beijing: Beijing Jiaotong University, in Chinese; Ahuja, R.K., Liu, J., Orlin, J.B., Solving real-life locomotive-scheduling problems (2005) Transportation Science, 39 (4), pp. 503-517; Schlechte, T., Railway track allocation: Models and algorithms (2012), Berlin: Technische University Berlin","He, B.; School of Traffic and Transportation, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing 100044, China",,,,,,,,10014632,,,,"Chinese","Zhongguo Tiedao Kexue",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84900222717

Large carriers enjoy market power from economies of scale and better networking. Small carriers rely on horizontal cooperation between each other to compete with, usually by trading on freight exchanges. One major challenge for small carriers is how to select requests so that the total profit from the delivery can be maximized. Thus in this paper we model it as a Profitable Pickup and Delivery Selection Problem, which is a generalization of the classic Pickup and Delivery Problem, but with a goal of profit maximization and it does not require all requests to be delivered. For a solution, we propose a simple graph search that traverses through feasible routes to solve the problem optimally. Preliminary computer experiments show that random Euclidean instances with up to 500 requests can be solved optimally within seconds in a single-vehicle setup, and up to 50 requests and 4 vehicles in minutes for the multi-vehicle cases, both of which are faster than the solution by the GUROBI Optimizer. For multi-vehicle cases, we also devise a greedy heuristic that is able to find a 99% optimal solution in less than a second.","Decision Support; Pickup and Delivery; Selective Pickup; Transportation; Vehicle Routing","Commerce; Decision support systems; Information systems; Optimization; Profitability; Transportation; Vehicle routing; Computer experiment; Decision supports; Euclidean instances; Horizontal cooperations; Pickup and delivery; Pickup and delivery problems; Profit maximization; Transportation markets; Problem solving",,,,,"Aráoz, J., Fernández, E., Meza, O., Solving the prize-collecting rural postman problem (2009) European Journal of Operational Research, 196 (3), pp. 886-896; Arda, Y., Crama, Y., Pironet, T., A profitable pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2008) ORBEL 22, 22nd Annual Conference of the Belgian Operations Research Society: SOGESCI-BVWB Belgian Operations Research Society; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Gribkovskaia, I., Laporte, G., Static pickup and delivery problems: A classification scheme and survey (2007) TOP, 15 (1), pp. 1-31; (2014) List of European Freight Exchanges, , http://brummifreund.de/e/freightexchanges.html, Accessed 02/10/2014; Carrabs, F., Cerulli, R., Cordeau, J.-F., An additive branch-and-bound algorithm for the pickup and delivery traveling salesman problem with LIFO or FIFO loading (2007) INFOR: Information Systems and Operational Research, 45 (4), pp. 223-238; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial - A-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 37 (6), pp. 579-594; Erdoǧan, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The attractive traveling salesman problem (2010) European Journal of Operational Research, 203 (1), pp. 59-69; (2006) Regulation (EC) on Road Driving Time and Rest Periods, , http://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/road/social_provisions/driving_time/, Accessed 03/24/2014; Annual road freight transport vehicle movements, loaded and empty, by reporting country (Mio veh-km, 1 000 jrnys) (2013) Statistics Data, European Commission, , http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=road_go_ta_vm, Accessed 02/20/2014; Gribkovskaia, I., Laporte, G., Shyshou, A., The single vehicle routing problem with deliveries and selective pickups (2008) Computers & Operations Research, 35 (9), pp. 2908-2924; Gulczynski, D., Golden, B., Wasil, E., The split delivery vehicle routing problem with minimum delivery amounts (2010) Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 46 (5), pp. 612-626; (2014) Gurobi Optimizer, , http://www.gurobi.com/, ver. 5.6.2; ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio, , http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/ibmilogcpleoptistud/; Ihde, T., (2003) Dynamic Alliance Auctions: A Mechanism for Internet-Based Transportation Markets, , Heidelberg: Physica-Verl; Physica-Verlag HD; Krajewska, M.A., Kopfer, H., Laporte, G., Ropke, S., Zaccour, G., Horizontal cooperation among freight carriers: Request allocation and profit sharing (2007) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 59 (11), pp. 1483-1491; Moura, A., Oliveira, J.F., An integrated approach to the vehicle routing and container loading problems (2009) OR Spectrum, 31 (4), pp. 775-800; Parragh, S.N., Doerner, K.F., Hartl, R.F., A survey on pickup and delivery problems: Part II: Transportation between pickup and delivery locations (2008) Journal für Betriebswirtschaft, 58 (2), pp. 81-117; Ropke, S., Cordeau, J.-F., Branch and cut and price for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2009) Transportation Science, 43 (3), pp. 267-286; Schönberger, J., Kopfer, H., (2005) Planning the Incorporation of Logistics Service Providers to Fulfill Precedence- and Time Window-Constrained Transport Requests in a Most Profitable Way, pp. 141-156. , Chapter 2.

On the other hand, to increase their competitiveness on the market, companies are asked to consider preferences of the customers as well. Therefore, tools for logistics management need to manage collective resources, as many depots and heterogeneous fleets, providing flexible preference handling at the same time. In this paper we tackle a pickup and delivery vehicle routing problem involving such aspects; customers place preferences on visiting time (represented as soft time windows), and their violation is allowed at a price. Our interest in this problem stems from an ongoing industrial project. First we propose an exact branch-and-price algorithm, having as a core advanced dynamic programming techniques. Then we analyze through a computational campaign the impact of soft time windows management on the optimal solution in terms of both routing and overall distribution costs. Our experiments show that our approach can solve instances of real size, and clarify the practical usefulness of soft time windows management. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg and Mathematical Optimization Society 2013.",,"Algorithms; Costs; Dynamic programming; Branch-and-price algorithms; Cost of transportation; Heterogeneous fleet; Industrial projects; Logistics management; Pickup and delivery; Pickup and delivery problems; Transportation enterprise; Integer programming",,,,,"Achterberg, T., (2007) Constraint Integer Programming., , PhD thesis, Technische Universität Berlin; Balakrishnan, N., Simple heuristics for the vehicle routing problem with soft time windows (1993) J.

The problem can be divided into several subproblems, including bus stop selection, assigning students to buses, and determining the bus routes. This work presents an exact branch-and-price framework for the SBRP, with a strong emphasis on efficiency issues inherently related to column generation (CG). Experiments are conducted on a set of 128 SBRP instances. Many of these instances are solved optimally; for the remaining instances, strong lower bounds have been derived.

We study the design of an interesting case, in which a bus operating in a public transport route may diverge from its nominal path to pick-up passengers with limited mobility and drop them off at their destination. We have modeled the design problem by a mixed integer-linear program, and we developed an exact Branch and Price approach to solve it to optimality. The proposed approach includes a labeling algorithm in which we introduced appropriate dominance rules, which do not compromise optimality. We have compared the efficiency of our approach with that of related algorithms from the literature. Furthermore, we have used the proposed approach to study key aspects of the system design problem, such as the effect of various constraints on the service level, and the tuning of the system's parameters to address different transport environments. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Branch and Price for MILP; Demand responsive transit systems; Door-to-door bus services; Paratransit systems","Mass transportation; Branch and price; Bus services; Labeling algorithms; Mixed integer linear program; Paratransit; Related algorithms; Transit systems; Transport environment; Integer programming; algorithm; numerical model; public transport; transportation mode; transportation system",,,,,"Brake, J., Mulley, C., Nelson, J.D., Wright, S., Key lessons learned from recent experience with flexible transport services (2007) Transport Policy, 14 (6), pp. 458-566; Broome, K., Worrall, L., Fleming, J., Boldy, D., Evaluation of flexible route bus transport for older people (2012) Transport Policy, 21, pp. 85-91; Chandra, S., Quadrifoglio, L., A model for estimating the optimal cycle length of demand responsive feeder transit services (2013) Transportation Research Part B, 51, pp. 1-16; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem: models and algorithms (2007) Annals of Operations Research, 153 (1), pp. 29-46; Crainic, T.G., Malucelli, F., Nonato, M., A demand responsive feeder bus system (2000), 7th World Congress Intelligent Transport Systems, 7WC-ITS, Torino, Italy; Crainic, T.G., Malucelli, F., Nonato, M., Guertin, F., Meta-heuristics for a class of demand-responsive transit systems (2005) INFORMS Journal on Computing, 17 (1), pp. 10-24; Daganzo, C.F., Checkpoint dial-a-ride systems (1984) Transportation Research Part B, 18 (4-5), pp. 315-327; Desaulniers, G., Desrosiers, J., Erdmann, A., Solomon, M., Soumis, F., VRP with pickup and delivery (2002) The Vehicle Routing, pp. 225-242. , SIAM Monographs on Discrete Mathematics and Applications, Philadelphia, P.

The aim is to find a set of routes, each assigned to a vehicle, in order to satisfy the set of requests, under capacity, time windows, precedence and pairing conditions. It is usually assumed that the demand of a request, picked up at its origin, is exactly delivered at its destination (one-to-one service) and that the fleet of the vehicles is based at a single depot. From a modelling point of view, the problem could be addressed as a one-to-one capacitated Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (PDPTW) and therefore, the mathematical formulation presents, beyond the traditional capacity constraints on the vehicles, also the pairing, the precedence and the time windows conditions. In particular, the pairing conditions guarantee that each couple (pickup, delivery) has to belong to the same route while the precedence constraints impose that each pickup has to be served before the associated delivery. This paper addresses the problem with the aim of optimizing, at the same time, the maximum total ride time and the total waiting time. Then, a bi-objective PDPTW with a constraint on the maximum duration of each route is proposed and solved by a two-step approach. In particular, the first step determines a set of feasible routes by meta-heuristics. These routes are used in second step in a bi-objective set partitioning formulation solved by the epsilon-constraint method to generate efficient solutions. The parameters of the meta-heuristics are properly set by a racing procedure. Computational experiments on some benchmark instances are carried out to assess the performance of the proposed approach. © 2014 The Authors.","Epsilon-constraint Method; Multi-objective Programming; Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows; Racing Methods; Vehicle Routing",,,,,,"Birattari, M., Stützle, T., Paquete, L., Varrentrapp, K., A racing algorithm for configuring metaheuristic (2002) GECCO '02: Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference, pp. 11-18; Chevrier, R., Liefooghe, A., Jourdan, L., Dhaenens, C., Solving a dial-a-ride problem with a hybrid evolutionary multi-objective approach: Application to demand responsive transport (2012) Applied Soft Computing Journal, 12 (4); Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transportation Research Part B, 37, pp. 579-594; Cordeau, J.F., A Branch-and-Cut Algorithm for the Dial-a-Ride Problem (2006) Operations Research, 54, pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem: Models and algorithms (2007) Annals of Operations Research, 153, pp. 29-46; Diana, M., Dessouky, M.M., A new regret insertion heuristic for solving large-scale dial-a-ride problems with time windows (2004) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 38 (6), pp. 539-557; Grandinetti, L., Guerriero, F., Pezzella, F., Pisacane, O., The Multi-objective Multi-vehicle Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (2014) Procedia- Social and Behavioral Sciences, 111, pp. 203-212; Guerriero, F., Bruni, M.E., Greco, F., A hybrid greedy randomized adaptive search heuristic to solve the dial-a-ride problem (2013) Asia-Pacific Journal of Operational Research, 30 (1); Hosny, M.I., Mumford, C.L., Single vehicle pickup and delivery with time windows: Made to measure genetic encoding and operators (2007) Proceedings of the 2007 GECCO Conference Companion on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation, pp. 2489-2496. , ACM Press New York, NY, USA; Hosny, M.I., Mumford, C.L., The single vehicle pickup and delivery problem with time windows: Intelligent operators for heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms (2010) Journal of Heuristics, 16 (3), pp. 417-439; Jorgensen, R.M., Larsen, J., Bergvinsdottir, K.B., Solving the Dial-a-Ride Problem Using Genetic Algorithms (2007) The Journal of the Operational Research Society, 58 (10), pp. 1321-1331; Kirchler, D., Wolfler Calvo, R., A Granular Tabu Search algorithm for the Dial-a-Ride Problem (2013) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 56, pp. 120-135; Liao, X.-L., Ting, C.-K., Solving the bi-objective selective pickup and delivery problem with memetic algorithm (2013) Proceedings of the 2013 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Production and Logistics, pp. 107-114; Li, H., Lim, A., A Metaheuristic for the Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (2003) International Journal on Artificial Intelligence Tools, 12 (2), pp. 173-186; Madsen, O.B.G., Ravn, H.F., Rygaard, J.M., A heuristic algorithm for a dial-a-ride problem with time windows, multiple capacities, and multiple objectives (1995) Annals of Operations Research, 60, pp. 193-208; Masson, R., Lehuédé, F., Péton, O., The dial-a-ride problem with transfers (2014) Computers and Operations Research, 41 (1), pp. 12-23; Muelas, S., Latorre, A., Peña, J.-M., A variable neighborhood search algorithm for the optimization of a dial-a-ride problem in a large city (2013) Expert Systems with Applications, 40 (14), pp. 5516-5531; Paquette, J., Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., Quality of service in dial-a-ride operations (2009) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 56 (4), pp. 1721-1734; Paquette, J., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Pascoal, M.M.B., Combining multicriteria analysis and tabu search for dial-a-ride problems (2013) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 52, pp. 1-16; Parragh, S.N., Doerner, K.F., Hartl, R.F., A survey on pickup and delivery problems I.

Such a service may replace the more traditional contract of affreightment (COA) which for decades has been the standard agreement between a tramp shipping company and a charterer. We present a mathematical formulation describing the routing and scheduling problem faced by a tramp shipping company that offers a VMI service to its customers. The problem is formulated as an arc-flow model, and is then reformulated as a path-flow model which is solved using a hybrid approach that combines branch-and-price with a priori path-generation. To solve larger, and more realistic, instances we present a heuristic path-generation algorithm. Computational experiments show that the heuristic approach is much faster than the exact method, with insignificant reductions in solution quality. Further, we investigate the economic impact of introducing a VMI service, by comparing the results obtained with the new model with results obtained by solving the traditional routing and scheduling problem faced by tramp shipping companies using COA.

It extends the classical Periodic Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (PVRPTW) to three types of demands of patients at home. Demands include transportation of drugs/medical devices between the HHC depot and patients[U+05F3] homes, delivery of special drugs from the hospital to patients, and delivery of blood samples from patients to the lab. Each patient requires a certain number of visits within a planning horizon and has a set of possible combinations of visit days. Daily routing should meet time window constraints associated with patients, the hospital and the lab. The problem consists in determining the visit days of each patient and vehicle routes for each day in order to minimize the maximal routing costs among all routes over the horizon. We propose a Tabu Search method combined with different local search schemes including both feasible and infeasible local searches. The proposed approaches are tested on a range of instances derived from existing Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Window (VRPTW) benchmarks and benchmarks on special cases of our problem. Numerical results show that local search scheme starting with an infeasible local search with a small probability followed by a feasible local search with high probability is an interesting hybridization. Experiments with field data from a HHC company show that the proposed approach reduces the total cost and better balances the workloads of vehicles. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Feasible local search; Home health care; Infeasible local search; Periodic vehicle routing; Tabu search",,,,,,"Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., Mercier, A., A unified tabu search heuristic for vehicle routing problems with time windows (2001) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 52, pp. 928-936; Bektas, T., The multiple traveling salesman problem: an overview of formulations and solution procedures (2006) Omega, 34, pp. 209-219; Carter, A.E., Ragsdale, C.T., Scheduling pre-printed newspaper advertising inserts using genetic algorithms (2002) Omega, 30, pp. 415-421; Gendreau, M., Hertz, A., Laporte, G., Stan, M.A., Generalized insertion heuristic for the traveling salesman problem with time windows (1998) Operations Research, 46, pp. 330-335; Savelsbergh, M.W.P., Local search in routing problems with time windows (1985) Annals of Operations Research, 4, pp. 285-305; Cordeau, J.F., Gendreau, M., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for periodic and multi-depot vehicle routing problems (1997) Networks, 30, pp. 105-119; Begur, S.V., Miller, D.M., Weaver, J.R., An integrated spatial DSS for scheduling and routing home-health-care nurses (1997) Interfaces, 27, pp. 35-48; Cheng, E., Rich, J.L., (1998) A Home Health Care Routing and Scheduling Problem.

We also consider an existing two-index vehicle-flow formulation and extend it by considering new families of valid inequalities and separation algorithms. We introduce new branch-and-cut algorithms for each of the formulations and compare them on a wide number of instances.

It concerns the delivery of drugs and medical devices from the home care company's pharmacy to patients' homes, delivery of special drugs from a hospital to patients, pickup of bio samples and unused drugs and medical devices from patients. The problem can be considered as a special vehicle routing problem with simultaneous delivery and pickup and time windows, with four types of demands: delivery from depot to patient, delivery from a hospital to patient, pickup from a patient to depot and pickup from a patient to a medical lab. Each patient is visited by one vehicle and each vehicle visits each node at most once. Patients are associated with time windows and vehicles with capacity. Two mixed-integer programming models are proposed. We then propose a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and a Tabu Search (TS) method. The GA is based on a permutation chromosome, a split procedure and local search. The TS is based on route assignment attributes of patients, an augmented cost function, route re-optimization, and attribute-based aspiration levels. These approaches are tested on test instances derived from existing VRPTW benchmarks. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In order to allow vehicles to avoid the stop at the dock and thus, reduce transportation costs, we introduce the Pickup and Delivery Problem with Cross-Docking (PDPCD). An Integer Programming formulation and a Branch-and-price algorithm for the problem are discussed. Our computational results indicate that optimal or near optimal solutions for PDPCD indeed allow total costs to be significantly reduced. Due to improvements in the resolution of the pricing problems, the Branch-and-price algorithm for PDPCD works better than similar algorithms for other models in the literature. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Branch-and-price; Column generation; Cross-docking; Pickup and delivery; Vehicle routing","Branch and price; Branch-and-price algorithms; Column generation; Computational results; Crossdocking; Integer programming formulations; Near-optimal solutions; Pickup and delivery; Pickup and delivery problems; Pricing problems; Transportation cost; Algorithms; Costs; Docks; Hydraulic structures; Integer programming; Vehicle routing; Docking",,,,,"Dantzig, G.B., Ramser, R.H., The truck dispatching problem (1959) Management Science, 6, pp. 80-91; Laporte, G., Fifty years of vehicle routing (2009) Transportation Science, 43, pp. 408-416; Laporte, G., Desrochers, M., Nobert, Y., Two exact algorithms for the distance constrained vehicle routing problem (1984) Networks, 14, pp. 161-172; Laporte, G., Nobert, Y., Desrochers, M., Optimal routing under capacity and distance restrictions (1985) Operations Research, 33, pp. 1050-1073; Pullen, H., Webb, M., A computer application to a transport scheduling problem (1967) Computer Journal, 10, pp. 10-13; Knight, K., Hofer, J., Vehicle Scheduling with timed and connected calls (1968) Operational Research Quarterly, 19, pp. 337-360; Savelsbergh, M.W.P., Local search in routing problems with time windows (1985) Annals of Operations Research, 4, pp. 285-305; Kallehauge, B., Formulations and exact algorithms for the vehicle routing problem with time windows (2008) Computers and Operations Research, 35 (7), pp. 2307-2330; Savelsbergh, M.W.P., Sol, M., The general pickup and delivery problem (1995) Transportation Science, 29, pp. 17-29; Subramanian, A., Drummond, L.M.A., Bentes, C., Ochi, L.S., Farias, R., A parallel heuristic for the vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickup and delivery (2010) Computers and Operations Research, 37 (11), pp. 1899-1911; Goetschalckx, M., Jacobs-Blecha, C., The vehicle routing problem with Backhauls (1989) European Journal of Operational Research, 42, pp. 39-51; Thangiah, S.R., Potvin, J.Y., Sun, T., Heuristic approaches to vehicle routing with Backhauls and time windows (1996) Computers and Operations Research, 23 (11), pp. 1043-1057; Christofides, N., Mingozzi, A., Toth, P., Exact algorithms for the vehicle routing problem based on the spanning tree and shortest path relaxations (1981) Mathematical Programming, 20, pp. 255-282; Fisher, M.L., Optimal solution of vehicle routing problems using minimum K-Trees (1994) Operations Research, 42, pp. 626-642; Fischetti, M., Toth, P., Vigo, D., A Branch-and-bound algorithm for the capacitated vehicle routing problem on directed graphs (1994) Operations Research, 42, pp. 846-859; Martinhon, C., Lucena, A., MacUlan, N., Stronger K-tree relaxations for the vehicle routing problem (2004) European Journal of Operational Research, 158, pp. 56-71; Baldacci, R., Hadjiconstantinou, E., Mingozzi, A., An exact algorithm for the capacitated vehicle routing problem based on two-commodity network flow formulation (2004) Operations Research, 52 (4), pp. 723-738; Fukasawa, R., Longo, H., Lysgaard, J., De Aragão, M.P., Reis, M., Uchoa, E., Robust branch-and-cut-and-price for the capacitated vehicle routing problem (2006) Mathematical Programming, 106 (3), pp. 491-511; Baldacci, R., Christofides, N., Mingozzi, A., An exact algorithm for the vehicle routing problem based on the set partitioning formulation with additional cuts (2008) Mathematical Programming, 115, pp. 351-385; Gendreau, M., Hertz, A., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the vehicle routing problem (1994) Management Science, 40, pp. 1276-1290; Gendreau, M., Laporte, G., Potvin, J.Y., Vehicle routing: Modern heuristics (1997) Local Search in Combinatorial Optimization, pp. 311-336. , Aarts E, Lenstra J, editors; Golden, B.L., Wasil, E.A., Kelly, J.P., Chao, I.M., Metaheuristics in vehicle routing (1998) Fleet Management and Logistics, pp. 33-56. , T.G.

Of notable significance are three key extensions to classical VRPs: (1) multi-depot scenario; (2) probabilistic demand and (3) time-window constraints, which are considered simultaneously with VRPs in this paper. The issue then becomes a Multi Depot Probabilistic Vehicle Routing Problem with a Time Window (MDPVRPTW). The underlying complexities of MDPVRPTW are analyzed and a heuristic approach is presented to solve the problem. Genetic algorithms (GAs) are found to be capable of providing an efficient solution to the so-called MDPVRPTW. Within the GAs, two modification operators namely, crossover and mutation, are designed specially to solve the MDPVRPTW. Three numerical examples with 14, 25, and 51 nodes are presented to test the efficiency of the algorithm as the problem size grows. The proposed algorithms perform satisfactorily and the limiting case solutions are in agreement with the constraints. Additional work is needed to test the robustness and efficiency of the algorithms as the problem size grows. © 2013, IGI Global.",,,,,,,"Alvarenga, G.B., Mateus, G.R., Tomi, G., A genetic and set partitioning two-phase approach for the vehicle routing problem with time windows.

The problem consists of deciding how to load every trailer, how to configure the vehicles in terms of the trailers, and how to route the vehicles, so as to minimize routing and fixed costs. The problem includes several features such as time windows on both customers and vehicles, multiple depots, multiple product delivery, split delivery, heterogeneous fleet, and dock capacity, to name a few. To solve this problem a GRASP-based heuristic is proposed. Problem decomposition, vehicle composition and route construction mechanisms, and local search procedures for different types of neighborhoods are developed. The heuristic is empirically assessed over a wide set of instances. Empirical results show that the proposed method obtains solutions of better quality than those reported by the company. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","GRASP; Heterogeneous fleet; Metaheuristics; Multi-commodity; Pickup and delivery; Vehicle routing","Beverages; Fleet operations; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; GRASP; Heterogeneous fleet; Meta heuristics; Multi-commodity; Pickup and delivery; Problem solving",,,,,"Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.F., Gribkovskaia, I., Laporte, G., Static pickup and delivery problems: A classification scheme and survey (2007) TOP, 15 (1), pp. 1-31; Castrillón-Escobar, A., (2013) Una Metaheurística para Un Problema de Carga Y Descarga en la Repartición de Bebidas Embotelladas, , Master thesis, Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León, San Nicolás de los Garza, Mexico March (in Spanish); Derigs, U., Gottlieb, J., Kalkoff, J., Piesche, M., Rothlauf, F., Vogel, U., Vehicle routing with compartments: Applications, modelling and heuristics (2011) OR Spectrum, 33 (4), pp. 885-914; Drexl, M., Applications of the vehicle routing problem with trailers and transshipments (2013) European Journal of Operational Research, 227 (2), pp. 275-283; Feo, T.A., Resende, M.G.C., Greedy randomized adaptive search procedures (1995) Journal of Global Optimization, 6 (2), pp. 109-133; Mitrović-Minić, S., Laporte, G., Waiting strategies for the dynamic pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2004) Transportation Research, 38 (7), pp. 635-655; Parragh, S.N., Doerner, K.F., Hartl, R.F., A survey on pickup and delivery problems, part II: Transportation between pickup and delivery locations (2008) Journal für Betriebswirtschaft, 58 (2), pp. 81-117; Qu, Y., Bard, J.F., The heterogeneous pickup and delivery problem with configurable vehicle capacity (2013) Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 32 (1), pp. 1-20; Ropke, S., Cordeau, J.F., Branch and cut and price for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2009) Transportation Science, 43 (3), pp. 267-286; Ropke, S., Pisinger, D., An adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2006) Transportation Science, 40 (4), pp. 455-472",,,"","Springer Verlag","4th International Conference on Computational Logistics, ICCL 2013","25 September 2013 through 27 September 2013","Copenhagen",100337,03029743,9783642410185,,,"English","Lect.

Our work manly extends the PDPTW to the case in which the fleet consists of electric vehicles (E-PDPTW), in order to exploit their significant advantages in terms of energy saving and sustainability. The E-PDPTW is then modeled as a multi-objective optimization problem in order to minimize the total travel distance, the total cost due to the used electric vehicles and the penalties due to the delayed services. In addition, beyond the classical vehicle routing constraints, in order to consider the practical difficulties due to the limited battery life of the electric vehicles (EVs) and to the poor availability of the recharging stations, some additional constraints are also imposed. The problem is then formulated as a multiobjective mathematical programming model and solved by applying the Weighted Sum Method (WSM) with weights determined by an approach derived from the Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP). Purpose What are the reason(s) for writing the paper or the aims of the research? The main goal of this research is to address a problem that presents many significant and relevant impacts, among the others : a reduction of the polluting emissions thanks to the use of EVs (environmental sustainability); an optimized delivery of door-to-door transportation services to the citizens and, in particular, to the elderly and disabled people (social sustainability) and finally, significant reductions in the use of fossil-fuel and considerable energy savings (economic sustainability). Design/methodology/approach How are the objectives achieved? Include the main method(s) used for the research. What is the approach to the topic and what is the theoretical or subject scope of the paper? Starting from the state-of-art, a multi-objective mixed integer linear formulation of the E-PDPTW is proposed with the aim to minimize the total travel distance, the total cost due to the used electric vehicles and due to the penalties for the delayed services. From a methodological point of view, the WSM is adopted in order to have a unique objective function, expressed as weighted sum of the above cited terms. In addition, in order to properly set the weights, a method, derived from the AHP, is proposed. Beyond the classical PDPTW constraints, additional conditions are imposed with reference to the use of EVs such as an upper bound on the total distance of each route. The final solution is then expressed in terms of both the optimal routes and the charging stations used in each of them. Originality/value What is new in the paper? State the value of the paper and to whom. The originality of the work consists in introducing the use of the EVs in the context of the multi-objective PDPTW. Moreover, the paper analyzes the routing problem of the EVs taking into consideration also the recharging stations, topic recently investigated in literature by very few researchers.","Analytical hierarchical process; Electric vehicle routing; Multi-objective mathematical programming; Pickup and delivery problem; Weighted sum method",,,,,,"Alvarenga, G.B., Mateus, G.R., De Tomi, G., A genetic and set partitioning two-phase approach for the vehicle routing problem with time windows (2007) Computers and Operations Research, 34, pp. 1561-1584; Bard, F.J., Kontoravdis, G., Yu, G., A branch-and-cut procedure for the vehicle routing problem with time windows (2002) Transportation Science, 36, pp. 250-269; Barnhart, C., Johnson, E.L., Nemhauser, G.L., Savelsbergh, M.W.P., Vance, P.H., Branch and price: Column generation for solving integer programs (1998) Operations Research, 46, pp. 316-329; Chen, X., Wan, W.S., Xu, X.H., The real-time time-dependent vehicle routing problem (2006) Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 42, pp. 383-408; Cohon, J.L., (1978) Multiobjective Programming and Planning, , New York [u.a.]: Acad.

This paper addresses a variant of the PDP where requests can change vehicle during their trip. The transfer is made at specific locations called ""transfer points."" The corresponding problem is called the pickup and delivery problem with transfers (PDPT). Solving the PDPT leads to new modeling and algorithmic difficulties. We propose new heuristics capable of efficiently inserting requests through transfer points. These heuristics are embedded into an adaptive large neighborhood search. We evaluate the method on generated instances and apply it to the transportation of people with disabilities. On these real-life instances we show that the introduction of transfer points can bring significant improvements (up to 9%) to the value of the objective function. © 2013 INFORMS.","Adaptive large neighborhood search; Pickup and delivery problem; Transfers","Optimization; Transportation routes; Adaptive large neighborhood searches; Delivery point; Objective functions; People with disabilities; Pickup and delivery problems; Specific location; Transfers; Pickups",,,,,"Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Dynamic pickup and delivery problems (2010) Eur.

This paper introduces a new version of the heterogeneous PDP in which the capacity of each vehicle can be modified by reconfiguring its interior to satisfy different types of customer demands. The work was motivated by a daily route planning problem arising at a senior activity center. A fleet of configurable vans is available each day to transport participants to and from the center as well as to secondary facilities for rehabilitative and medical treatment. The number of participants and support equipment that a van can accommodate depends on how it is configured.The problem is modeled as a mixed-integer program much the same way as a PDP but with side constraints that add another level of complexity. To find solutions, we developed a two-phase heuristic that makes use of ideas from greedy randomized adaptive search procedures with multiple starts. In phase I, a set of good feasible solutions is constructed using a series of randomized procedures. A representative subset of those solutions is selected as candidates for improvement by solving a max diversity problem. In phase II, an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) heuristic is used to find local optima by reconstructing portions of the feasible routes. Specialized removal and insertion heuristics were designed for this purpose. Also, a specialized route feasibility check with vehicle type reassignment is introduced to take full advantage of the heterogeneous nature of vehicles. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by comparing the solutions it provided over a period of several weeks with those that were used in practice and derived manually. The analysis indicates that anywhere from 30% to 40% savings can be achieved with the multi-start ALNS heuristic. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Adaptive large neighborhood search; Configurable vehicle capacity; Dial-a-ride problem; Heterogeneous vehicles; Pickup and delivery problem","Customer satisfaction; Integer programming; Optimization; Pickups; Trucks; Adaptive large neighborhood searches; Dial-a-ride problem; Heterogeneous vehicles; Pickup and delivery problems; Vehicle capacity; Vehicles; heuristics; neighborhood; public transport; transport vehicle; transportation planning",,,,,"Baldacci, R., Battarra, M., Vigo, D., Routing a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles (2008) The Vehicle Routing Problem: Latest Advances and New Challenges, pp. 3-27. , Springer, New York, B.L.

The problem is to find the shortest route to collect and distribute commodities under the assumption that the total supply and the total demand are in equilibrium. This study presents a novel problem formulation, called the selective pickup and delivery problem (SPDP), by relaxing the constraint that all pickup nodes must be visited. Specifically, the SPDP aims to find the shortest route that can supply delivery nodes with required commodities from some pickup nodes. This problem can substantially reduce the transportation cost and fits real-world logistic scenarios. Furthermore, this study proves that the SPDP is NP-hard and proposes a memetic algorithm (MA) based on genetic algorithm and local search to resolve the problem. A novel representation of candidate solutions is designed for the selection of pickup nodes. The related operators are also devised for the MA; in particular, it adapts the 2-opt operator to the sub-routes of the SPDP for enhancement of visiting order. The experimental results on several SPDP instances validate that the proposed MA can significantly outperform genetic algorithm and tabu search in terms of solution quality and convergence speed. In addition, the reduced route lengths on the test instances and the real-world application to rental bikes distribution demonstrate the benefit of the SPDP in logistics. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In reality, however, many trucks are running empty or with a partial load. Bridging such residual capacity with real time transportation demand enhances the efficiency of the carriers. We therefore introduce the Position-Aware-Market (PAM), where transportation requests are traded in real time to utilize transportation capacities optimally. In this paper we mainly focus on the decision support system for the truck driver, which solves a profit- maximizing Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (PM-PDPTW). We propose a novel Recursive Branch-and-Bound algorithm that solves the problem optimally, and apply it to a Tabu-Search heuristic for larger problem instances. Simulations show that problems with up to 50 requests can be solved optimally within seconds. Larger problems with 200 requests can be solved approximately by Tabu-Search in seconds, retaining 60% of the optimal profit. © (2012) by the AIS/ICIS Administrative Office All rights reserved.","Green logistics; Less-than-truckload; Logistics optimization; PDP; PDPTW; Profit maximization; Transportation market","Green logistics; Less-than-truckload; Logistics optimization; PDP; PDPTW; Profit maximization; Transportation markets; Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Decision support systems; Heuristic algorithms; Information systems; Logistics; Profitability; Tabu search; Truck drivers; Truck transportation; Trucks; Freight transportation",,,,,"Applegate, D.L., Bixby, R.E., Chvatal, V., Cook, W.J., (2007) The Traveling Salesman Problem: A Computational Study (Princeton Series In Applied Mathematics), , Princeton University Press; Aráoz, J., Fernández, E., Meza, O., Solving the prize-collecting rural postman problem (2009) European Journal of Operational Research, 196 (3), pp. 886-896; Archetti, C., Feillet, D., Hertz, A., Speranza, M.G., The capacitated team orienteering and profitable tour problems (2008) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 60 (6), pp. 831-842; Balas, E., New classes of efficiently solvable generalized traveling salesman problems (1999) Annals of Operations Research, 86, pp. 529-558; Bartolini, E., (2009) Algorithms For Network Design and Routing Problems.

The vehicle contains a number of (horizontal) stacks of finite capacity for loading items from the rear of the vehicle. Each stack must satisfy the last-in-first-out constraint that states that any new item must be loaded on top of a stack and any unloaded item must be on top of its stack. A branch-and-cut algorithm is proposed for solving this problem. Computational results are reported on different types of randomly generated instances as well as on classical instances for some well-known special cases of the problem. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The fleet of ships is heterogeneous and fixed for the planning horizon, and no common depot exists. The cargoes picked up and delivered consist of both mandatory and optional cargoes, and each cargo may be split among several ships. The objective is to design a route for each ship that will maximize the total profit from transporting all the mandatory and a subset of the optional cargoes. To solve this problem we introduce a new path-flow formulation, which we solve by branch-price-and-cut. The subproblem is a new variant of the elementary shortest path problem with resource constraints, where a multi-dimensional knapsack problem is solved to compute optimal cargo quantities.

We focus on a scheduling problem for autonomous micro-ferries, where the task of assigning transportation requests to specific micro-ferries and determining the order of handling them is done centrally. The method is based on the travelling salesman problem and vehicle routing problem with time-windows, but differs in the inclusion of constraints on the energy-consumption and an increased flexibility in travel times, which are both influenced by varying the speed of the micro-ferries. This results in a mixed-integer non-linear programming problem, which can be transformed into a mixed-integer linear programming problem by using an approximation of the speed variables. © 2012 AACC American Automatic Control Council).",,"Energy-consumption; Increased flexibility; Mixed integer linear programming; Mixed-integer nonlinear programming; Scheduling problem; Time windows; Travelling salesman problem; Variable speed; Vehicle Routing Problems; Scheduling; Traveling salesman problem; Problem solving",,,,,"Rotterdam, S., 1600 Ha-implementation Programme 2007-2015, , stadshavensrotterdam.nl; Savelsbergh, M., Sol, M., The general pickup and delivery problem (1995) Transportation Science, 29 (1), pp. 17-29. , Feb; Ropke, S., Cordeau, J., Branch and cut and price for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2009) Transportation Science, 43, pp. 267-286; Bektas, T., The multiple traveling salesman problem: An overview of formulations and solution procedures (2006) Omega, 34 (3), pp. 209-219; Kulkarni, R.V., Bhave, P.R., Integer programming formulations of vehicle routing problems (1985) European Journal of Operational Research, 20 (1), pp. 58-67; Cordeau, J., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem (DARP): Variants, modeling issues and algorithms (2003) 4OR: A Quarterly Journal of Operations Research, 1 (2), pp. 89-101; Itani, S., Frazzoli, E., Dahleh, M., Dynamic traveling repairperson problem for dynamic systems (2008) Proc. of the 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, pp. 465-470. , Cancun, Mexico, Dec; Fossen, T., (2002) Marine Control Systems-guidance, Navigation and Control of Ships, Rigs and Underwater Vehicles, , 1st ed.

To solve this problem two different metaheuristics are used: Tabu Search and Genetic Algorithms. Based on these techniques a hybrid algorithm is developed. The main goal is the development of a Hybrid Algorithm focused on the Vehicle Routing Problem which uses the intensification power of the Tabu Search and the diversification power of the Genetic Algorithms, in order to obtain good quality solutions without compromising the computational time. In the experiments are combined policies of diversification and intensification in Tabu Search and Genetic Algorithm to verify the efficiency and robustness of the proposed hybrid algorithm. Finally, the results are compared with the best heuristic and exact methods results found in the literature. The Hybrid Algorithm here proposed shows efficiency and robustness, with several optimal solutions achieved.

The work presented here was inspired by a daily route planning problem at a regional air carrier who was trying to determine the benefits of transshipment. Accordingly, a primary goal of this paper is identify the circumstances under which measurable cost saving can be achieved when one aircraft transports a request from its origin to an intermediate point and a second aircraft picks it up and delivers it to its final destination. In structuring the analysis, we describe a unique way to model this transshipment option on a directed graph and introduce a specialized two-route insertion heuristic that considers when to exploit this option. Based on the new representation, most existing heuristics for the PDP can be readily extended to handle transshipments. To find solutions, we developed a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) with several novel features. In the construction phase, shipment requests are inserted into routes until all demand is satisfied or no feasible insertion exists. In the improvement phase, an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm is used to modify portions of the feasible routes. Specialized removal and insertion heuristics were designed for this purpose. In the absence of test cases in the literature, we also developed a procedure for randomly generating problem instances. Testing was done on 56 existing PDP instances which have 50 requests each, and on 50 new data sets with 25 requests each and one transshipment location.

For a given fleet of vehicles (or service personnel) the goal of a VRP is to seek delivering products or services to various customer doorsteps at minimal cost (that can be represented by travel time, distances, or some customized ones) while satisfying the imposed business rules such as the vehicle capacities, the route length traversed by a vehicle, the working hours (schedules) of a driver or service person. It is known that the VRP is a difficult problem to be solved to its global optimality within a reasonable computational time. In order to solve VRPs from the real world more effectively, many algorithms, particularly heuristics, were designed and implemented to tackle this type of problems. Recently the well-known savings approach of Clarke and Wright was re-considered and some enhanced versions were proposed aiming to achieve improved solutions for the VRP. The goal of this paper is to present a business scenario requiring VRP solutions, and to propose an enhanced Clarke and Wright algorithm in the spirit of those proposed recently to solve the problems of this case study. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm aims at eliminating the human interventions such as parameter setting and tuning during the problem solving procedures. Computational results demonstrate that the new algorithm addresses the business needs better in the real applications and the results obtained by the algorithm are preferred by the end users. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Case Study; Decision Support; Savings Algorithm; Vehicle Routing Problem","Business needs; Business rules; Business scenario; Computational results; Computational time; Decision supports; End users; Global optimality; Human intervention; Minimal cost; Optimization problems; Parameter setting; Problem-solving procedures; Real applications; Route length; Service personnel; Vehicle capacity; Vehicle routing problem; Vehicle Routing Problems; Working hours; Algorithms; Decision support systems; Fleet operations; Human computer interaction; Network routing; Optimization; Research; Routing algorithms; Problem solving",,,,,"Altinel, I.K., Oncan, T., A new enhancement of the Clarke and Wright savings heuristic for the capacitated vehicle routing problem (2005) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 56, pp. 954-961; Battarra, M., Golden, B., Vigo, D., Tuning a parametric Clarke-Wright heuristic via a genetic algorithm (2008) Journal of the Operational Research Society, 59, pp. 1568-1572; Bodin, L., Golden, B., Assad, A., Ball, M., Routing and scheduling of vehicles and crews: The state of the art (1983) Computers & Operations Research, 10, pp. 63-212; Bozkaya, B., Cao, B., Aktolug, K., Routing solutions for the service industry (2011) Hybrid Algorithms for Service, Computing and Manufacturing Systems: Routing and Scheduling Solutions, pp. 46-78. , Montoya- Torres, J.R., Juan, A.A., Huatuco, L.H., Rodriguez-Verjan, G.L.

Main reasons for launching public bike program is to reduce carbon footprint so as to prevent greenhouse effect and to solve Last-Mile problem in order to make convenient for citizens. However, we may encounter awkward cases in peak hours (from 7:00 to 9:00 and 17:00 to 19:00) that no bike is available at some stations or no vacant place is left to put bikes. The actual solution in most cities is in a traditional way based on call centers. A personnel taking charge of bikes in a certain zone reallocates bikes among bike stations based on notification of bike users by telephone call when bike stations are full or empty. This inefficient solution will reduce bike utilization and even annoy bike users. In this paper, we propose a system & methodology to intelligently guide personnel to reallocate bikes among stations, aiming at overcoming the above awkward cases and maximizing bike utilization. © 2012 IEEE.",,"Call centers; Telephone calls; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Greenhouse effect; Bicycles",,,,,"DeMaio, P., Bike sharing: Its history, models of provision, and future Velo City Conference, 2009; Ropke, S., Cordeau, J., Laport, G., Models and branch-and-cut algorithms for pickup and delivery problems with time windows (2007) Networks, 49 (4), pp. 258-272; Ropke, S., Cordeau, J., Branch and cut and price for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2009) Transportation Science, 43 (3), pp. 267-286; Li, H., Lim, A., A metaheuristic for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows International Conference of Tools Artificial Intelligence, 2001; Lai, M., Cao, E., An improved differential evolution algorithm for vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickups and deliveries and time windows (2010) Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 23 (2), pp. 188-195; Lu, Q., Dessouky, M., An exact algorithm for the multiple vehicle pickup and delivery problem (2004) Transportation Science, 38 (4), pp. 503-514; Baldacci, R., Mingozzi, A., An exact algorithm for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2011) Operations Research, 59 (2), pp. 414-426; IBM Ilog Cplex Solver 12.0","Li, J.; Supply Chain Management and Logistics Research, IBM Research-China, Diamond Building 19-A, Donbeiwang West Road No.8, Beijing, 100193, China; email: ljinfeng@cn.ibm.com",,,,"2012 9th IEEE International Conference on Networking, Sensing and Control, ICNSC 2012","11 April 2012 through 14 April 2012","Beijing",90782,,9781467303880,,,"English","Proc.

This problem is characterized by the presence of heterogeneous vehicles and patients. In our problem, two types of vehicles are used, each providing a different capacity for four different modes of transportation. Patients may request to be transported either seated, on a stretcher or in a wheelchair. In addition, some may require accompanying persons. The problem is to construct a minimum-cost routing plan satisfying service-related criteria, expressed in terms of time windows, as well as driver-related constraints expressed in terms of maximum route duration limits and mandatory lunch breaks. We introduce both a three-index and a set-partitioning formulation of the problem. The linear programming relaxation of the latter is solved by a column generation algorithm. We also propose a variable neighborhood search heuristic. Finally, we integrate the heuristic and the column generation approach into a collaborative framework. The column generation algorithm and the collaborative framework provide tight lower bounds on the optimal solution values for small-to-medium-sized instances. The variable neighborhood search algorithm yields high-quality solutions for realistic test instances. © 2010 The Author(s).","Column generation; Dial-a-ride-problem; Passenger transportation; Variable neighborhood search",,,,,,"Beaudry, A., Laporte, G., Melo, T., Nickel, S., Dynamic transportation of patients to hospitals (2009) OR Spectrum, 32, pp. 77-107; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Gribkovskaia, I., Laporte, G., Static pickup and delivery problems: a classification scheme and survey (2007) Top, 15, pp. 1-31; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Dynamic pickup and delivery problems (2010) Eur J Oper Res, 202, pp. 8-15; Černy, V., Thermodynamical approach to the traveling salesman problem: An efficient simulation algorithm (1985) J Opt Theory Appl, 45, pp. 41-51; Cordeau, J.-F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Oper Res, 54, pp. 573-586; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., A tabu search heuristic for the static multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2003) Transport Res B Meth, 37, pp. 579-594; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., The dial-a-ride problem: models and algorithms (2007) Ann Oper Res, 153, pp. 29-46; Danna, E., Lepape, C., Branch-and-price heuristics: a case study on the vehicle routing problem with time windows (2005) Column Generation, pp. 99-129. , G.

Today VRP is probably one of the most widely encountered types of problems for routing and distribution in the service industry. Examples include furniture delivery to a customer's address, scheduling of bus service pick-up/drop-off for students or company personnel, or service technician routing. The goal of this chapter is to provide a background, mathematical model and various solution approaches on a more commonly encountered variant of the problem, namely the VRP with Time Windows (VRPTW). The authors also present three case studies from their experience in the service industry that are real applications of VRPTW. For each study, they describe the overall approach and methodology, and the positive contributions to the respective company which has implemented enterprise-scale GIS-based systems around the distribution problem of interest. © 2012, IGI Global.",,,,,,,"Ahmmed, A., Rana, M.A.A., Haque, M.A.A., Mamun, M.A., A multiple ant colony system for dynamic vehicle routing problem with time window (2008) Proceedings of International Conference on Convergence and Hybrid Information Technology, pp. 182-187. , In, IEEE;

The problem arises from an industry application, and includes pickup requests, delivery requests, and pickup-and-delivery requests. Each pickup-and-delivery request can be served either as direct delivery by one truck, or by being picked up and transported to the cross-dock by one vehicle, and subsequently delivered at its final destination by another vehicle. Handling times at customers sites and terminal are given. A typical daily instance includes 500-1,000 requests.

The problem arises from an on-demand transportation system developed in a rural zone in France, where the objective of encouraging people meeting is pursued. We address the solution of the problem with a column generation approach, applied to a set partitioning formulation where the objective function is fractional. Based on the literature on linear fractional programming, two methods are developed to deal with this fractional objective. Experiments permit to compare these two approaches and to evaluate the impact of the new objective compared to a standard min-cost or min-time optimization. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

A fleet of vehicles, without fixed routes and schedules, carries people from their pickup points to their delivery points, during a pre-specified time interval. It can be modeled as an -hard routing and scheduling problem, with a suitable mixed integer programming formulation. Exact approaches to this problem are too limited to tackle real-life instances: time dependent network, requests received on-line, different objective functions. In this paper we propose an algorithm to solve the off-line Dial-a-Ride Problem (darp), based on a Granular Tabu Search method.

Athena, Greece","In the dynamic Pickup and Delivery Problem with Transfers (dPDPT), a set of transportation requests that arrive at arbitrary times must be assigned to a fleet of vehicles. We use two cost metrics that capture both the company's and the customer's viewpoints regarding the quality of an assignment. In most related problems, the rule of thumb is to apply a two-phase local search algorithm to heuristically determine a good requests-to-vehicles assignment. This work proposes a novel solution based on a graph-based formulation of the problem that treats each request independently. Briefly, in this conceptual graph, the goal is to find a shortest path from a node representing the pickup location to that of the delivery location. However, we show that efficient Bellman-Ford or Dijkstra-like algorithms cannot be applied. Still, our method is able to find dPDPT solutions significantly faster than a conventional two-phase local search algorithm, while the quality of the solution is only marginally lower. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","dynamic shortest path; Pickup and delivery problem","Bellman-Ford; Conceptual graph; Cost metrics; Dynamic shortest path; Graph-based; Local search algorithm; Novel solutions; Pickup and delivery; Pickup and delivery problem; Pickup and delivery problems; Rule of thumb; Shortest path; Fleet operations; Graph theory; Learning algorithms; Pickups",,,,,"Agrawal, R., Jagadish, H.V., Materialization and incremental update of path information (1989) ICDE, pp. 374-383; Bent, R., Hentenryck, P.V., A two-stage hybrid algorithm for pickup and delivery vehicle routing problems with time windows (2006) Computers and Operations Research, 33 (4), pp. 875-893; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., Dynamic pickup and delivery problems (2010) European Journal of Operational Research, 202 (1), pp. 8-15; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.F., Gribkovskaia, I., Laporte, G., Static pickup and delivery problems: A classification scheme and survey (2007) TOP, 15, pp. 1-31; Carraway, R.L., Morin, T.L., Moskowitz, H., Generalized dynamic programming for multicriteria optimization (1990) European Journal of Operational Research, 44 (1), pp. 95-104; Cheng, J., Yu, J.X., On-line exact shortest distance query processing (2009) EDBT, pp. 481-492; Cohen, E., Halperin, E., Kaplan, H., Zwick, U., Reachability and distance queries via 2-hop labels (2002) SODA, pp. 937-946; Cooke, K.L., Halsey, E., The shortest route through a network with time-dependent internodal transit times (1966) Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications, 14 (3), pp. 493-498; Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., Ropke, S., Recent Models and Algorithms for One-to-One Pickup and Delivery Problems (2008) Vehicle Routing: Latest Advances and Challenges, pp. 327-357. , Kluwer, Dordrecht; Cordeau, J.F., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the dial-a-ride problem (2006) Operations Research, 54 (3), pp. 573-586; Cortés, C.E., Matamala, M., Contardo, C., The pickup and delivery problem with transfers: Formulation and a branch-and-cut solution method (2010) European Journal of Operational Research, 200 (3), pp. 711-724; Ding, B., Yu, J.X., Qin, L., Finding time-dependent shortest paths over large graphs (2008) EDBT, pp. 205-216; Dreyfus, S.E., An appraisal of some shortest-path algorithms (1969) Operations Research, 17 (3); Dumas, Y., Desrosiers, J., Soumis, F., The pickup and delivery problem with time windows (1991) European Journal of Operational Research, 54 (1), pp. 7-22; Gendreau, M., Guertin, F., Potvin, J.Y., Séguin, R., Neighbourhood search heuristics for a dynamic vehicle dispatching problem with pick-ups and deliveries (2006) Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 14 (3), pp. 157-174; Goldberg, A.V., Harrelson, C., Computing the shortest path: A search meets graph theory (2005) SODA 2005: Proceedings of the Sixteenth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, pp. 156-165; Goldberg, A.V., Kaplan, H., Werneck, R.F., Reach for A*: Efficient point-to-point shortest path algorithms (2006) Proc. of the 8th WS on Algorithm Engineering and Experiments (ALENEX), pp. 129-143. , SIAM, Philadelphia; Granat, J., Guerriero, F., The interactive analysis of the multicriteria shortest path problem by the reference point method (2003) European Journal of Operational Research, 151 (1), pp. 103-118; Guerriero, F., Musmanno, R., Label correcting methods to solve multicriteria shortest path problems (2001) Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications, 111 (3), pp. 589-613; Jing, N., Huang, Y.W., Rundensteiner, E.A., Hierarchical encoded path views for path query processing: An optimal model and its performance evaluation (1998) TKDE, 10 (3), pp. 409-432; Jung, S., Pramanik, S., An efficient path computation model for hierarchically structured topographical road maps (2002) TKDE, 14 (5), pp. 1029-1046; Kriegel, H.P., Renz, M., Schubert, M., Route skyline queries: A multi-preference path planning approach (2010) ICDE, pp. 261-272; Li, H., Lim, A., A metaheuristic for the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2001) ICTAI, pp. 333-340; Mitrović-Minić, S., Krishnamurti, R., Laporte, G., Double-horizon based heuristics for the dynamic pickup and delivery problem (2004) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 38 (7), pp. 669-685; Mitrović-Minić, S., Laporte, G., Waiting strategies for the dynamic pickup and delivery problem with time windows (2004) Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 38 (7), pp. 635-655; Mitrović-Minić, S., Laporte, G., The pickup and delivery problem with time windows and transshipment (2006) INFOR, 44 (3), pp. 217-228; Orda, A., Rom, R., Shortest-path and minimum-delay algorithms in networks with time-dependent edge-length (1990) J.

If a customer is absent when the vehicle serves the pickup location, the request is fulfilled by an alternative service (e.g., a taxi) whose cost is added to the total cost of the tour. In this case, the vehicle skips the corresponding delivery location, which yields a reduction in the total tour cost. The aim of the problem is to determine an a priori Hamiltonian tour minimizing the expected cost of the solution. This problem is solved by means of an integer L-shaped algorithm. Computational experiments show that the algorithm yields optimal solutions on several instances within reasonable CPU times. It is also shown that the actual cost of an optimal solution obtained with this algorithm can be significantly smaller than that of an optimal solution obtained with a deterministic formulation. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In the PDPTW, a set of identical vehicles located at a central depot must be optimally routed to service a set of transportation requests subject to capacity, time window, pairing, and precedence constraints. In this paper, we present a new exact algorithm for the PDPTW based on a set-partitioning-like integer formulation, and we describe a bounding procedure that finds a near-optimal dual solution of the LP-relaxation of the formulation by combining two dual ascent heuristics and a cut-and-column generation procedure. The final dual solution is used to generate a reduced problem containing only the routes whose reduced costs are smaller than the gap between a known upper bound and the lower bound achieved. If the resulting problem has moderate size, it is solved by an integer programming solver; otherwise, a branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm is used to close the integrality gap. Extensive computational results over the main instances from the literature show the effectiveness of the proposed exact method. © 2011 INFORMS.","Column generation; Dual ascent; Pickup and delivery; Set partitioning","Bounding procedures; Branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm; Column generation; Computational results; Dual ascent; Dual solutions; Exact algorithms; Exact methods; Integrality gaps; Lower bounds; LP-relaxation; Pickup and delivery; Pickup and delivery problem with time windows; Precedence constraints; Reduced cost; Set partitioning; Time windows; Upper Bound; Vehicle routing problem with time windows; Algorithms; Integer programming; Pickups; Vehicle routing",,,,,"Baldacci, R., Christofides, N., Mingozzi, A., An exact algorithm for the vehicle routing problem based on the set partitioning formulation with additional cuts (2008) Math.
