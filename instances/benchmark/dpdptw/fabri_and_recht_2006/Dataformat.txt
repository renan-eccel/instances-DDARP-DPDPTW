Each instance consists of the two files
   <Name> _coord.csv
   <Name> .csv

In the file <Name> _coord.csv the coordinates of the places to be approached are in the Cartesian coordinate system.
The Euclidean distance is taken as a basis.

The file contains in each line:
Number of the place; x-coordinate; y coordinate

The place No. 0 is the depot.



The file <name> .csv contains all information about the vehicles and the orders.

In the first line are the vehicle data:
Number of vehicles; Capacity; lower time slot limit; upper time window limit

The following lines contain the orders:
No. of pickup location; No. of delivery location; lower time window limit pickup; upper time window limit pickup; lower time window limit Delivery; upper time window limit Delivery; required capacity; Call time; Service time pickup; Service time delivery

Firt Line: |K|;Q;0;H
Others:    i;i+n;e_i;l_i;e_{i+n};l_{i+n};q_i;a_i;d_i;d_i

To the origin of the instances:

Based on the test data sets for the Pickup and Delivery VRP with Time Windows (PDVRPTW) from Li & Lim,
which were derived from the Solomon benchmarks.

The following procedure was used to generate the test data records:

1. For each job, a random call time was generated, ranging from 0 to the minimum of lower
Pickup time window limit and upper delivery time window limit minus the travel time from pickup to
Delivery location is. Then the orders were sorted in order of their call time.

2. The number of vehicles has been reduced: there are only as many vehicles available as in the best
known solutions for the PDVRPTW from Li & Lim (as of September 2004).
